2737,24966779,2015-01-04,10493776,Ia,"Elif was really very helpful, while arranging reservation of the single room I rented at her flat. The room was clean and cosy, with all the furnishing that was necessary for comfortable stay in Rome. Mr. Picchioni was really helpful and helped me to feel as comfortable as possible."
2737,29770086,2015-04-12,29630601,Julia,"Elif's flat is spacious, clean, and had everything I needed for a wonderful introduction to Rome.  I did not get to meet Elif, but she was patient and responsive when I was trying to make the booking.  I met Daniele, her husband, who clearly loves Rome and was always happy to offer suggestions on where to go, what to do, or how to get there.  Excellent hosts that made me want to live in Italy!"
2737,30477570,2015-04-22,31215535,Sevil,I had a wonderful time staying with Elif and her family. The rooms location was so close to the center that getting from place to place was so easy! I really enjoyed coming back to the apartment after a long days walk. The bed was so comfortable and it was great having my own bathroom. This is my first airbnb experience and it defiantly was a positive one!
2737,31659336,2015-05-08,1959813,Suzy,"Elif was a brilliant host, with an exceptionally clean home, very calm room with own bathroom, perfectly located in the up and coming Ostiense neighbourhood, five minutes from the amazing Eataly food emporium."

2903,282,2008-11-16,3734,Teresa,"Very nice room, great area, all very new and clean. Breakfast token included for the cafe downstairs. Shared bathroom with 2 rooms, so can get crowded, but worked fine in general. Totally recommandable!"
2903,318,2008-11-28,3726,Katherine,"Everyone was nice and friendly, the rooms and bathrooms new-looking and clean.  The location was also excellent.  I would def. stay here again."
2903,562,2009-01-21,5120,Joseph,The location is great - very close to city center and old Rome...lots of fun cafes and shops nearby.  The room is clean and simple; Andrea and his wife are very friendly and accommodating.  Thumbs up!
2903,794,2009-02-23,7671,Tina,"Great Location in the Heart of Roma.
Rooms were clean at a adequate price.
You have to check out the Restaurantes next to the Hostel!
If we stay in Rome, itÂ´s our first choice.

2903,1911,2009-04-30,10045,Mark,"Andrea and his wife were great hosts, and very helpful.  The rooms and bathrooms were very clean, and large!  Awesome location! Nearby: excellent restaurants, bars, shopping, and more! We will recommend this BnB to all our friends."
2903,3591,2009-06-06,15600,Bernard,We could only find availability at Andre's place for one night but it was a very nice experience. Both he and his wife were lovely to deal with and extremely helpful. Cant beat the location or though on when we first arrived we thought it would be loud from the torrent of street traffic but I slept like a baby. Recommended
2903,5580,2009-07-15,21066,Anthony,Bathroom was clean and the bedroom was cozy as well as the location itself. The ticket provided for breakfast at the bar downstairs served great coffee and was a pleasant touch to our stay at Calisto6.  
2903,5957,2009-07-22,23879,Allison,"lovely room & clean bathroom. also, andrea is very kind. although he was not home when we arrived, he answered his mobile phone several times when we needed help and had questions about the building.

note: Americans who like a big breakfast... be aware that the breakfast offered in the cafe downstairs is just a croissant and a cappucino."
2903,5987,2009-07-23,13266,Jennifer,"Andrea was wonderful and so friendly. The room was nice and clean and the bathroom was so spacious. We only stayed for one night, but it was great. Thanks Andrea and we hope to see you again! "
2903,6061,2009-07-25,20102,Ryan,"Andrea was very friendly and helpful upon our arrival in Rome. His apartment is in the wonderful Trastevere area of Rome, away from the touristy areas, but still close enough to walk to all the major sites. The apartment's location ensures an authentic Rome experience with beautiful piazzas, great restaurants, and an amazing atmosphere. Thanks Andrea!!"
2903,9703,2009-09-11,28950,Christopher,"If what you're looking for is a simple, friendly place right in the heart of Rome, then Calisto 6 is perfect. Set above a lively bar, popular with the locals, the apartment is spacious, clean, and nice and cool even in the Roman summer heat. Andrea welcomed us and, even though we didn't have any problems, was there when we needed to ask him something. He allowed us to leave our luggage in the apartment during our last day as our flight home wasn't until late, and this really helped us to enjoy our final day hassle-free. 

The location is superb, we couldn't have asked for anything more. Trastavere is a wonderful place; a picturesque quarter of Rome away from the tourists, but very central and within walking distance of all the sights. There are plenty of shops, and dozens of great restaurants to choose from. 

We had an amazing time in Rome, and Calisto 6 was the perfect base to enjoy it from. We'll be back! Highly recommended.

Chris and Abbi.

2903,21040,2009-12-21,60522,Kelsey,We had a great experience at the B&B. We really enjoyed the breakfast in the morning at the downstairs bar and the Trastevere area is beautiful and less expensive for meals. It was a 30 minute walk to the monuments but we enjoyed exploring the city this way. I will recommend this place to my friends and family when they visit me in Europe! Andrea and his wife were very helpful and were always available when I needed something. Thank you!
2903,24821,2010-01-25,33284,Araz,"Andrea's Bed and Breakfast was delightful and in the heart of Trastevere. The tram/bus stops were only a short walk away, however for those keen on walking...all the sights of Rome are only around 20min away. We had a very large, tastefully decorated room with a private bathroom across the hall which was cleaned daily. When another guest suddenly fell ill, Andrea promptly organised another local bnb. Lots of local restuarants in one of Rome's most charming locations."
2903,25908,2010-02-12,70424,Scott,"I also had a terrific experience at Calisto 6. The location can't be beat for exploring Rome, and Andrea was a very helpful and accommodating host. Trastavere is also a hip neighborhood to have an authentic Roman experience. Like others here, I will recommend this place to family and friends should they ever have the good fortune to visit The Eternal City. "
2903,35506,2010-04-14,63454,Travis & Annie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Calisto 6. The location was perfect. Far enough away from the tourist hub to be more authentic neighborhood, yet close enough to all the major sites for exploring. The room was both spacious and updated. The bathroom, although a little small, meet our needs. Andrea was a great host and assisted us in finding authentic restaurants and cafes as well as recommended many cites to visit. We will definately stay at Calisto 6 on our next trip to Rome. Thanks Andrea!"
2903,40718,2010-05-08,81652,Peter,"We had a really nice stay with Andrea, He really goes a long way to make things work, full of information, great resource, immaculately clean. Trastevere is the place to stay if you want to be where romans live, not a touristy place. Life living over a street cafe for a few days is a Roman Holiday. Street noise is not a real problem, stay up late or go to bed with ear plugs. Thank you Andrea."
2903,71414,2010-07-31,146141,Krishna,"We spent 4 days here with kids. Andrea and his wife seem like nice people, easy to deal with. This facility however was not what we were hoping for.

Bathroom is not attached (across the coridor).

I would not consider this a bed and breakfast. Breakfast is really a coupon for the bar downstairs (not particularly a clean bar where I would go with the family). The coupon gets you a coffee and one croissant (yes just that). We ended up buying breakfast outside - we needed more than just that.

Room is air cooled (not air conditioned). It was barely sufficient for the nice weather we were fortunate to enjoy. If its a hot day, I doubt it will be adequate.

The host does not live there so there is no way to get any help outside of 10am to 5pm (which is when most tourists are out sight seeing). For instance, there was no soap or hand towels in the bathroom and we had to wait for the host to return the next morning after 10am to request those.

There was no way to leave luggage after you checkout since the host is not there on the weekend during the day. We ended up leaving it in a common area (which we are not comfortable doing but didn't have a choice).

All in all, for the price, it does not provide adequate facilities in my opinion.

"
2903,77008,2010-08-11,186640,Elaine,"When we arrived, we were informed that the room had been double-booked, and the woman we were meeting told us that she had found us a room for a night in a ""nearby"" bnb called the Trastevere Inn. She (Tammy) expected us to transfer back to the original bnb after a night, but that defeated the purpose of staying in the same place for two nights, so we decided to stay there instead. We never actually spoke to an owner, were never given a real rate for the room. We felt taken advantage of because we were paying 90 Euros a night at Calisto, and the Trastevere Inn advertised a 75 Euro/night rate - we were never offered a refund. When we tried to check out of the Trastevere Inn, we were told that because it was after 10 am we would have to pay for that night as well (apparently that's how it is ""all over Italy"", although that wasn't true in our experience). The breakfast at the Trastevere Inn was prepackaged food and instant coffee, but it seems that breakfast at Calisto would have only been a coupon to go to a nearby bar (coffee and croissant, I think). Overall, I would not recommend this place or Trastevere Inn to anyone. It was very unprofessional and manipulative, with a bad breakfast to boot. However, stay in the Trastevere area, there are lots of good restaurants, the neighborhood is nice, and it is walking distance (long walks) from Vatican City and the Colosseum. "
2903,78837,2010-08-15,182279,Tim,"The location is great, except the B&B is right on top of a bar that stays open late. A family emergency took Andrea out of town, but the arrangements he made to cover were totally unsatisfactory. There was no-one at the apt when we arrived, no-one answering at the advertised contact number, and and no information about who to contact.  Luckily the guy who was supposed to be running the place showed up, and could let us in.  He was unaware of the prepayment through airbnb, and insisted we should pay him. It was quite a hassle to persuade him that we should not. This arrival experience was common to other guests we met. The portable aircon unit in the room failed, and no-one was available to fix it. As others have commented the so-called breakfast is a coupon for a croissant and cappucino in the bar downstairs or at some other bar nearby. The day we checked out we were not given any grace period to store bags, even though there is an ample common area, and one might expect a service-oriented business to try to make amends for previous crappy service. Given the circumstances I am reluctant to post a negative review, but this is an amateurish operation. Trastevere is great, but I would recommend you find an alternative to this place."
2903,82032,2010-08-21,104584,Rosanna,"Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Andrea and his wife as they were unexpectedly called out of town. Andrea was helpful in writing me to let me know who to call to arrange for the key pick-up when we arrived. We weren't blown away by the facilities but they were certainly sufficient--the bedroom was clean and tiny, and the air conditioning worked relatively well. We shared a bathroom down the hall with a few other guests but we rarely saw them.
The neighborhood is lovely. The place opens up on a piazza and is right next door to another piazza with a beautiful church and lots of nightlife. We found a great gelateria down the street and had no problem walking across the river to visit tourist attractions like the Colosseum and Forum.
As for the breakfast, we were able to take advantage of it the first morning. It seemed like a standard Italian breakfast to me: coffee or tea and a pastry. The next morning we wanted to leave by 9, and the cafe wasn't yet open. "
2903,91878,2010-09-07,112962,Sam And Tiks,"Location was great and we would agree with most of the other comments regarding the property.
Andrea's partner and staff were really helpful and friendly whenever we had contact with them. Yes breakfast is downstairs at the bar - typically Italian breakfast of coffee and pastery.
Unfortunately we were feeling a little unwell for our 7 nights in Rome, and as the weather was hot the room was almost unbearably hot with the window closed and the 'air conditioner' on. The first couple of nights we tried to sleep with the window open but the noise from the bar sounded like we were sleeping on the floor of a pumping nightclub! We would have joined the party, but as I have already mentioned we were not exactly feeling that well, so not in the party mood...
I would recomend this place for the great location, fine food all around the place, price, etc...but be aware that over summer if you are looking for a quiet room then this is probably not the place for you."
2903,95770,2010-09-13,131216,Terra,"We had a wonderful stay at Calisto 6. Andrea and his wife keep the place spotless and are very accommodating.

When we first arrived there was some confusion regarding our reservation as they had overbooked the first house. However they quickly took us to their other rental house only 2 blocks away and we were very satisfied. The place is fully furnished with new beds and the bathrooms were spotless. We felt right at home. The only complaint was that the air conditioner was difficult to operate.

We were 10mins walking distance to all of the main sites and a 10min bus ride to the main train station. 

I would recommend this place to friends and family"
2903,158871,2010-12-27,249293,Christianne,"Staying at the Travestere B&B was overall a great experience. The rooms are beautifully decorated and quite large. They are also very, very clean. Though we did not originally have some of the key items we needed (hand towel, soap, meal passes for breakfast which is not in the B&B, but in a bar downstairs) we received them quickly after asking. 

I would highly recommend the blue room. "
2903,180501,2011-02-10,346457,Elisabeth,"This was an amazing place to stay.  Andrea and his wife were excellent hosts and really make sure that everything is clean and bright in the rooms.  They really pay attention to detail.  I suggest that you request the blue room.   The room is a little noisy with the windows open because there is a busy bar just below the place.  If you have problems with noise, this might not be the place for you.  If you want an authentic experience and feel like you are part of action the whole time, this is the place for you.  I can't recommend this place enough."
2903,270695,2011-05-19,447166,Jenn,"The location of the bed and breakfast was great!  It is a trendy neighborhood with great restaurants and bars nearby.  The bedrooms were cleaned daily and had great ventilation.

However, the bathrooms were not up to par.

Although Andrea was great with responding to our concerns.  The first night, the bathroom light went out and it was quickly replaced.  "
2903,335026,2011-06-26,540449,Abby,"Staying at Calisto 6 was a great experience! The Traverstere area of Rome is refreshing and away from the crowds of tourists. There is a beautiful square steps away, and charming streets with great restaurants. The room was very cute and clean. We had a wonderful stay!"
2903,382744,2011-07-19,626260,Ryan,"Everything was great, the apartment, service, etc.  Would definitely stay there again!"
2903,400812,2011-07-27,505472,Daniel,"Fantastic apartment that was very clean and beautifully decorated. Location was perfect, right in the middle of heaps of restaurants, bars and cafes, and even summer concerts in the nearby piazza! Walking distance to all the sights and public transport was close as well. Would definetly stay there again"
2903,445957,2011-08-15,724876,David,"We actually stayed in another flat of Andre & Nariya on the other side of the Piazza of Santa Maria in Trastevere. It is a three story apartment with two bedrooms with two private bathrooms. As four adults we stayed very comfortably in the space. It also has a nice living room and a kitchen with a breakfast nook area. The unit was very comfortable & clean (a cleaning woman came every morning) and excellently located in a great part of Rome, well positioned to access the great center of Rome's highlights. The place included a breakfast; fairly standard fair, packaged cornettos, cereal & milk, & yoghurt, as well as a little pod based espresso machine. Only limitation was we couldn't do any cooking. This is a reasonably priced, comfortable, centrally located place in which to enjoy the delights of Rome."
2903,683260,2011-11-01,1279307,Nate,Had a great stay at the Calisto - very nice host and extremely helpful.  The neighborhood in Trastevere is unbeatable - great restaurants and great vibe.  The place is also comfortable and very clean.  
2903,809608,2011-12-28,1278005,Milashini,"Calisto 6 is charming, spacious, comfortable, very clean, and within walking distance from many of the main attractions of Rome.  Andrea is a very accommodating host.  She provided us with maps of the city, recommended restaurants and places of interests to us, and readily answered all our questions.  We really enjoyed our stay"
2903,1295999,2012-05-17,1671170,Amanda,"Andrea's B&B was so nice and made our stay in Rome such a great experience for my husband and I. Andrea even helped us find a place to stay for our first night in Rome after our original airbnb hosts fell through. I highly recommend Calisto6 and Andrea's friendly, accommodating service. "
2903,1434058,2012-06-07,531022,Julie And Peter,Andrea and his wife were fine hosts and the room is clean with a comfortable bed in a truly marvelous Trastevere neighborhood right over a bustling bar.  The lively activity outside til the wee hours didn't not deter us from getting a nice deep sleep and the complimentary cappuccino we had at the bar the next morning was primo!
2903,1641198,2012-07-06,1131834,Lisa,"This was a fantastic first-time Airbnb experience. Andrea had excellent communication prior to my arrival in Rome, and we were greeted very kindly by his wife who provided us with a map and some local tips. The room was very clean and spacious, and the bathroom across the hall had everything we needed. This is the best location to stay in my opinion. It had a very local feel whereas many other areas in Rome are very overtaken by tourists. The bar below the room was no problem, the windows seem to be very new and cancel out the sound, particularly when the air conditioner is running. Andrea was even kind enough to book me a taxi very late at night on short notice, which I was very thankful for. Overall, I had a great time here and would stay again."
2903,1808234,2012-07-26,548712,Michael,"Our stay at Calisto6 B&B was very pleasant. The room was quiet, cool, and comfortable. The B&B is very well-located, next to Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere. Andrea was a gracious host, easy to get in touch with, and very friendly."
2903,1816760,2012-07-27,3022550,Dilip,"We had a fun stay in Andrea's bnb in Rome. Many restaurants and shops within walking distance. Good privacy, did not see much of Andrea. Though we didn't stay long (one night). Everything was clean and the internet was fast. The bathroom was down the hall and shared and the AC not the best. Also next to a square that was pretty noisy at night."
2903,2081571,2012-08-24,2389897,Katherine,"Great location!! In addition, the room was very clean and comfortable. Small complaint: when we would leave for the day, we would return to find anything we had left plugged in to charge (cell phone or ipad) unplugged! We ended up having no phones/internet for the entire stay because of this. "
2903,2616423,2012-10-15,633282,Susanna,"The location is fantastic- we would stay there again!  Just a little bit of info: It was a bit hard to find so we tried calling Andrea but there was no answer, we started to worry and thought something was wrong but we persevered and found it - I hadn't read his instructions properly! Then when we got there we met Andrea's colleague.  She showed us the room (with private bathroom just across the corridor) and then we filled in the forms.  There is no member of staff at the place at all (except for when you arrive - you have to tell Andrea your ETA) so before she left we borrowed an extra towel, hairdryer and even an umbrella!   The rooms were fine- clean, warm and comfy!  We didn't use the TV.  Underneath there is a bar which, thanks to the double glazing, you can't hear any noise from late at night!   P.S. Low shower!"
2903,2862981,2012-11-12,915945,Jana,"It was a great stay at Calisto6 and Andrea was really friendly and helpful. We loved the room: very cozy, charming and clean. And the area is also great. A lot of nice restaurants and bars. Only the Calisto Bar in the building could be a little bit noisy, but than you have to go down for a drink ;) thank you Andrea and your wife for the great accomandation!"
2903,3004493,2012-12-01,387844,Mike,Nice room and a great location. Right near many restaurants and bars.  Andrea's wife gave me some recommendations for places to go and sent me to the best pizza place I've ever been to.  Thanks! The only downside was that the bathroom wasn't directly connected to the room and was pretty small. I'd definitely stay there again if I ever return to rome!
2903,3036528,2012-12-06,2684557,Molly,This is the best location in Rome! Not too touristy but a within walking distance to all the major attractions.  The room was very cute and clean. And best of all Andrea lent me his converter so I could charge my phone. Would definitely go back. 
2903,3140438,2012-12-23,2131706,Alexander,"Despite the rather noisy bar below our room, the Calisto6 was an ideal place to stay while in Rome. Steps away from Santa Maria in Trastevere, the rooms were large and very well appointed in comparison to many other affordable options in Rome. Andrea was outside waiting for us upon arrival and gave us some really excellent restaurant recommendations as well. I would absolutely stay there again."
2903,3323975,2013-01-10,4403308,Rebma,"This place was perfect! Andrea was so incredibly nice, and accommodating. The B&B is immaculate and located in a relatively low key yet super convenient location. I will be back!:)"
2903,3846160,2013-03-20,4940239,James,"Really lovely B&B... The incredibly clean and well-apportioned accommodations were charming and the location perfectly dropped in the midst of Trastevere. Sure, the Bar customers could cause a murmur outside your window, but going down for a drink is always an option. It IS a local favorite. All in, we were thoroughly pleased and would happily (happily!) return."
2903,3928964,2013-03-28,4546163,Julie,This is a great place but you need to commit to going to bed after about 2:30 or 3:00 am when the bar just below and outside the window closes.
2903,4022051,2013-04-03,5142855,Tuyen,"Andrea was a great host. He was extremely helpful along the way and responded very fast!! The bnb was nice but not as big as it looks in the pictures. Also, the bathrooms had a weird moldy smell but it was tolerable. Breakfast is continental with cereal milk yogurt and toast. The location is convenient. We walked everywhere to the colosseum, Vatican City, roman forums and trevi fountain! Right outside the bnb is a plaza with bars and restaurants so that was convenient! There is a kitchen but the house rules restrict us from cooking. Nonetheless,  We enjoyed our stay!  "
2903,4117459,2013-04-11,5307141,Veeral,"Unfortunately, I had a few negative experiences. Initially I booked viccolo de piede and Andrea contacted me saying there had been an error and he had intended to book me at Calisto 6 where he had availability. He assured me the properties were similar with a private bathroom so I agreed to transition to Calisto 6. Upon arrival, we waited over 1 hr for his colleague to meet us for key transfer after arriving in Rome. I had to make multiple international phone calls to coordinate this. The bathroom at Calisto 6 is not attached to the room, so you have to go across the hall and open the door with a key. The ceiling in the bathroom is just over 6 feet at its highest so I had to crouch over to use the bathroom. Furthermore, the ceiling is slanted so it goes well below 6 feet at it's lowest. The following morning we did not have hot water in our shower and waited an hour for someone to come address this. Andrea did apologize by leaving a bottle of Chianti and did allow for late checkout on our final day, however overall our experience was disappointing. "

2903,8448444,2013-10-31,9000376,Bettina,"Andrea war ein sehr zuverlÃ¤ssiger, hilfsbereiter und freundlicher Gastgeber. Das 3er-Zimmer etwas klein, aber hÃ¼bsch eingerichtet, sauber und trotz der zentralen und lÃ¤rmigen Lage (direkt Ã¼ber einer rege besuchten Bar) dank der guten Fenster sehr ruhig. Wir haben den Aufenthalt extrem genossen und kÃ¶nnen das Calisto6 B&B jederzeit wÃ¤rmstens weiterempfehlen!"
2903,28450210,2015-03-23,29383374,Stefano,La posizione della casa Ã¨ fantastica! fra i vari alloggi provati a Roma nel corso degli anni il b&b di Andrea Ã¨ sicuramente il migliore per posizione. Molto belle anche le camere e le finiture interne. 
2903,35881723,2015-06-22,26062030,Pasang,"We had a lovely time staying at Andrea's place in Piazza Calisto. Great rooms and very welcoming. Very popular bar downstairs and the piazza was very busy and packed with partygoers at night-time. Good food locally in Piazza Cosimato. Very clean and well maintained, descriptions were all accurate. Thank you for having us Andrea!"
2903,49296760,2015-10-02,9302988,Vicky,"nice, clean, good spot for nightlife but very noisy
in the street there is a big bar where there are people gathering day and night, itÂ´s fun but difficult to get a sleep"
2903,88495941,2016-07-24,26943665,Desiree,Andrea was a great host. the apartment was great and the location also. I recommend taking the breakfast voucher up at Baylon Cafe over downstairs.

3079,162748,2011-01-02,194932,"Finca Los CastaÃ±eros, S.L.","The place is ok. Do not expect anything fantastic but rather normal. There is no central heating but three stoves instead. During hard winter you must have anything on to keep the place warm. Location is good and there are shops around to buy groceries and bread. I would have expected finding things like coffe or coffe filters but it may be that my expectations were too high and are maybe unusual, but those were my expectations. The place is quiet and you will sleep well. It is on a first floor with no elevator but it is just one floor so it is ok unless you have problems with that. I found the place a bit expensive for what you get, but again, it may very well be that Rome is like that and hotels are more expensive."
3079,425456,2011-08-07,588964,Maggie,"The best feature of this apartment was the rooftop terrace with great views of the Colosseum. Perfect spot for some local Pizza, watching the sunset  after a long day of visiting the sites. The apartment is basic and has everything our family of 4 needed. Our host was very friendly and accommodating."
3079,656148,2011-10-23,1008235,Arjun,"Lovely location, perfect for sightseeing and Paola was a perfect host. She gave us a ton of valuable information."
3079,1122570,2012-04-13,2021977,Jane,Laura was a wonderful host! She met us promptly to check in and provided us with everything we needed for the week. The apartment is really cozy and in a perfect location. Laura even arranged us a car service to the airport. I high recommend saying in her apartments!
3079,1572956,2012-06-27,1670673,Carol,"We enjoyed staying in this apartment.  The location is wonderful.  We found shops, transportation, everything we needed very close at hand.  It was a little cramped for three persons, but could easily accommodate two. "
3079,2301437,2012-09-17,2898851,Caroline,"A beautiful apartment with a fantastic location very close to the Colosseum. The view of the Colosseum from the rooftop patio is lovely--definitely suggest having a glass of wine and watching the sunset up there.

The apartment was clean and equip with all the necessities and more (hair dryer, dishes, A/C, small tv, towels, maps, umbrella, laundry, wi-fi etc.). The furniture looked new and the whole apartment was aesthetically appealing. The noise from the nearby fountain--popular for an evening drink and chat--didn't bother us at all, in fact we much enjoyed joining in on the daily festivities in the square. 

Laura was extremely helpful and sat down with us right away and mapped out many of the main attractions giving us many details we otherwise wouldn't have known. While we didn't end up contacting her much during our stay, she let us know she was available if we had any questions about anything (activities, transportation, etc.). We did contact her about getting to the airport for our very early flight and she made arrangements for a taxi on our behalf. 

Overall a lovely stay and well worth the $. Definitely recommend this apartment to others. "
3079,3221709,2013-01-02,4053713,Faraz,"Laura was a wonderful host and even thoug we did not meet her, as she was on holidays, she was very responsive, even though we were there during Xmas. Always available on email and her house keeper even took us out for breakfast on Xmas day as everywhere was mostly closed!!
The place was slightly tight for 3 adults and a teenager, but that is to ne expected from most places in Rome.
VERY central; less than 3mins walk to the Colosseum, close to the Jewish Ghetto and a short cab ride to most other places of interest - 30min walk to the Vatican and most musuems!!

Highly recommended!!"
3079,6873063,2013-08-28,7709829,Michael,"We had a wonderful week in Rome at Via Serpenti. The apartment in in a great position. A short walk to the Colosseum, and 15 min walk to Trevi and Pantheon.  Then catch the little Elettrico bus 117 back to Via Serpenti.
We arrived quite late on out first day. Laura was waiting at the door for us, and was always available with advice and suggestions. This was a perfect place for our first visit to Rome."
3079,7813574,2013-10-04,6907025,Valeska,Laura is a lovely host. Her apartment is very comfortable and easy to reach from the train station. We had a lovely stay in Rome thanks to Laura and her hospitality.
3079,8045925,2013-10-14,8545839,Alyce,"Great location, comfortable apartment and very, very helpful and responsive host.  We spent 10 days in this apartment and loved every minute of it.  The neighborhood of Monti is unique in that it is so close to the Coliseum, Ruins and other sights but feels far away from the tourist scene in the piazza, restaurants and street life.  Laura made herself very available (by email when she was not in the building) and was responsive to any and all of our requests and needs.  Oh - and there was plenty of hot water for the shower; always a bonus!"
3079,8467496,2013-11-01,8800838,Benedicte,"Excellent location for visiting Rome. Also great and very lively neighbourhood. Excellent and responsive host.
Only drawback: the flat is in front and therefore noisy especially in the evenings and at night. Double glazed windows do offer good relief but you have to keep them closed at night!
"
3079,8673165,2013-11-11,9380899,Allan,"The place was great! Plenty of room and so close to the colosseum!
Only reservation is the wifi was spotty on our phones. Other than that it was wonderful."
3079,13752024,2014-06-03,4397075,Amy,"My husband and I, along with another couple, spent the weekend in Rome at Laura's apartment.  She was easy to communicate with, quick to respond and helpful with recommendations.  Check-in was flexible, easy and Laura gave us some good recommendations.  Throughout our stay she was always available.  The apartment was definitely small for four adults but it was fine for the weekend.  The location was great - close to many sites, restaurants/bars, and shops! I would definitely recommend Laura's apartment to anyone going to Rome!"
3079,48765873,2015-09-28,36358164,GÃ¶sta,We hade pleasant stay at Via dei Serpenti. Laura was really nice and helpful. I can recommend the apartment to anyone who like to stay very central. It was perfect.
3079,259113430,2018-04-30,43977963,Al,Great location in Monti. Noisy with windows open. Lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Colosseum is right down street. 5 minute walk to Cavour metro station.
3079,289316196,2018-07-12,158921556,Graham,Great place in a great location. When I return to Rome I will be staying again.

11834,246099,2011-05-01,346365,Joanne,"We loved our stay at Boschetto House. It was a cute apartment with everything we needed and in a fantastic location. Only a 5 minute walk to the Colosseum.
We had a present of Easter Eggs and home made biscuits waiting for our arrival from Serena. Also the manager Hassan gave us some helpful information when checking in.
I will be recommending this apartment to anyone going to Rome and we would definitetly stay here again.
"
11834,343799,2011-06-30,388909,Eteri,Everything was perfect! The apartment in a perfect location - only few minutes from Colosseum and Roman Forum. The apartment is clean and cosy and comfortable.  Very nice courtyard.
11834,529617,2011-09-13,953228,Ginger,"Apartment: Very nicely set up for guests - well decorated and plenty of space, very clean, with all the amenities of home. This was a GREAT apartment. There is a dehumidifier/AC available. The apartment is tucked away in an apartment building courtyard and is very quiet - however, as a result of being in the center of the complex, the apartment gets very little natural light in the morning. It does brighten up well throughout the day. 

Neighborhood: Great neighborhood, just a very short walk from the Colosseum. Tip: If you want to see the Colosseum, go buy tickets at the Palantino, just a few minutes walk away, where the line is short, then come back and bypass the line at the Colosseum - it's absolutely worth it. The apartment was close to restaurants and bars and easy walking from other areas of Rome. We routinely walked to Campo dei Fiori and back and found it quite easy. 

Host: Serena is wonderful! She put a lot of thought into the careful details of the apartment and we felt quite taken care of. She was easy to reach and very responsive, she showed us around the apartment and told us about good things to do and gave us a map. She even took the time to look up an activity I'd had a question about and then email me with the details. THANK YOU, SERENA!"
11834,641971,2011-10-18,1001902,Rajiv,"We had a fine stay in this charming apartment right next to the Coliseum. Walking distance to major spots in Ancient Rome. Very charming street with cozy shops. The owner Serena was very personable, helpful on transportation and little things like calling a cab to the airport and other logistics. This is a ground floor unit so that helped a lot. Don't miss the little restaurant around the corner that is always packed. "
11834,846583,2012-01-07,128550,Pierre,"Very nice place, very nice stay, very available host, very nice area for visits and restaurants. For dinner, you can go to ""il 16"" or ""il 19"" (same numbers in ""via del boschetto""). Thanks Serena."
11834,1112235,2012-04-12,1811395,Maaike,"The location was fantastic, very easy to get to and from the airport as well as all big must sees in Rome. We loved to stroll around the streets later at night and enjoy one of the many amazing wine bars. We also loved the bakery's and  cafe's for breakfast and lunch in the immediate area. 

The apartment was clean, bright and just a pictured. We even had some cookies when we arrived. Serna was a great host, easy to reach for general questions regarding the place and was very helpful as we had a late check-in. Also as I accidentally forgot to pack my blowdryer Serena was super helpful with finding a solution! Thank you for our wonderful stay !!"
11834,1515001,2012-06-19,1984482,Bruna,"On my first 12h hours in Rome, I managed to have an accident and open my head at Fonta di (Website hidden by Airbnb) it's not a Woody Allen screenplay, it truly happened!!! We were so lucky we were staying at Serena's because she came all the way from her house to help my husband (who was at the hospital with me, where no one spoke English!) and was a true angel, don't know how we've managed it without her being there!
But if you're not planning to visit a Roman hospital or getting a Roman scar, Serena is also a great host for giving local tips and has a charming place, in a very trendy and central spot, where she received us with homemade cookies and lots of smiles! The apartment is very complete and has a good bed, shower and AC, essential for the harsh summer we faced there!!"
11834,1768122,2012-07-22,2432893,Chet,Rome is Amazing! 
11834,2222744,2012-09-07,163201,Sean,"Serena was on vacation during our visit, but she made arrangements for me to meet with someone at the front door, which worked out just fine. The house is a cute little studio with a Murphy bed. The flat was perfect. Serena even snuck back one day to leave my wife and I a welcome gift (thank you!!).

The Monti neighborhood is an up and coming hip spot to be after dark, with a good number of twenty-somethings meeting at a nearby plaza/fountain to discuss politics, their days, etc. over beer and wine. Also nearby are a good number of great restaurants and cafe's, not limited to Italian cuisine (check out Mother India and Noozo sushi). To top it all off, the flat is a three block walk away from the Colosseum."
11834,2280066,2012-09-14,1120338,Paul,"This flat has so much character! My sister and I loved our stay here! The space was perfect and the location was amazing! We walked a block over and could see the top of the colloseum! 10 minute walk to all the must see sites of rome and its near a metro station to get to the Vatican pretty easily too.

Also, Serena is a great host! She is met up with us for some drinks and showed us some sites nearby the apartment that we had overlooked. She went over and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant time in Rome. Hassan, her friend, checked us into the flat and provided thorough information on whats near the flat (such as landmarks, supermarkets, phone stores, etc)."
11834,2368077,2012-09-22,2484150,Tracy,We loved this little alcove in the heart of Rome! ;) It was fully kitted with all that is needed (including a washing machine) & just 5min from the Colessum!  We would recommend it in a heart-beat!
11834,2598955,2012-10-13,2374658,Dean,"Serena is an incredible host, from the incredible biscuits we received upon checking in, to the help she provided with directions, maps, tips etc. and taking time out to have a drink with us, she is one of the best airbnb hosts we've come across.
Location wise you couldn't ask for much better - 5 mins walk from the colosseum a and Roman forum, 10 mins to Trevi fountain, and 2 min walk to the bus stop that takes you straight to the Vatican.
The apartment itself has everything you need and comes as stated. The bed is a lot cosier than I thought it would be for a fold out bed. The only thing I'll mention on the negative is that the apartment can get quite dark, which makes getting up some days tough, especially with all the walking we did around Rome! Oh and if you're worried about the lack of Internet, there's a cafe right across the street with free wifi that came in very handy. We will definitely be staying here again when next in Roma!"
11834,2730745,2012-10-27,3694902,(Website hidden by Airbnb),"Hello!
We were in Rome in mid October.
Serena's apartment was great! Right in the heart of Rome, from the street we could see the Coliseum and still have quiet and privacy. Even has a sweet balcony ! We even got a cake baked by Serena's mom!
The apartment is very well equipped, clean and comfortable! What you see in the pictures is what you get!!!!
We met with Serena and met a lovely woman! An intelligent, impressive, pleasant and courteous! Enjoyed talking to her about Italy and Israel and everyday life!
We strongly recommend Serena's apartment and Serena as a hostess!
Enjoy Italy :)"
11834,2827675,2012-11-07,3796898,Aude,"Charmant petit, studio, extrÃªmement bien situÃ© dans le centre de Rome. L'accueil de SÃ©rÃ©na est trÃ¨s sympathique et c'est parfait pour diner le soir  quand on rentre fourbus des visites de Roma Capitale!!
Allez y.
Aude"
11834,3262207,2013-01-04,1875860,Valeria,"We were in Rome over New Year's and had an amazing stay at Serena's place. She was a brilliant host, met us for the check in and gave us all we needed including some lovely home-made biscuits which her mum had prepared! The apartment is really cute, right in the middle of Rome (5 minute walk from the Colosseum - and when we say a 5 minute walk, it really is that short!!) It's spacious enough for a couple and really nicely decorated. We so appreciated that Serena had also taken the time to put some Christmas decorations around the place, which made it feel even more like home. We strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to have an easy stay in the centre of Rome and feel that everything is within reach. And if you're looking for a nice restaurant where to try Roman specialities at a very reasonable cost, with great service and a cosy atmosphere, try the Taverna dei Fori Imperiali, via della Madonna dei Monti 9!"
11834,3788506,2013-03-15,4930022,Kathryn,"My stay at the Boschetto house was absolutely wonderful. In fact, the flat was one of my favorite parts of Rome! Serena was a wonderful host who made sure that we had absolutely everything we needed. The amenities included in the charming flat are well beyond any experience you can get in a hotel. Plus, the location cannot be beat - just blocks away from the colosseum,  close to everything on a street lined with quaint shops + restaurants. I highly recommend staying here (I've already told all my friends) and, should I return to Rome, this will be my first choice in accommodations. "
11834,3835615,2013-03-19,1666897,Victoria,"Serena's flat was adorably decorated, warm, and quiet! Serena also does a great job in hosting as the flat included snacks, chocolates, maps, and recommendations. It was minutes walk from the Cavour station and easy to get to places once you find it once.  I would recommend this place.

Serena is a very solicitous owner! She helped us with maps and places of intereasting to get Rome better. 
The appartement is very interesting and unusual - with paintings and carpets on the walls. It is a studio with 1 big bad, kitchen and a small cloack room (where second bed could be placed if it is necessary). So it would be good for a couple. 
The location is perfect!

11834,4126955,2013-04-12,5249308,Roberto,"Ho trovato l'appartamento in una bellisima zona della movida Romana, senza subirne il chiasso. Un monolocale molto carino, curato nei dettagli, poi ciliegino sulla torta, una splendida accoglienza di Serena, che ci ha fatto trovare tutte le cose per le prime neccessitÃ , dal latte ai biscotti alla frutta all'aqcua, the caffe ecc. casa pulita molto accogliente, spazi giusti per 3 persone. L'appartamento ha una posizione invidiabile, sei a due passi da tutto il centro storico, a 300 metri hai la stazione della metropolitana, a due passi trovi ristoranti pizzerie bar ecc tutto quello che ti serve! Raccomandabile

11834,4204139,2013-04-18,5370295,Jeamie,"Our experience in Rome was absolutely lovely! 
Serena's small and quiet flat is very clean and comfy.
The location is simply amazing. We actually got lost on our way to the apartment and found ourselves at the foot of the Colosseum! We walked to all the touristic destinations from the apartment, always stopping by the excellent coffee shop, right next door. Serena was kind enough to wait for us as our plane was late. She was very welcoming and took the time to show us the map of Rome, with her own special recommendations. The private terrasse, the washing machine and the AC are just other nice things that make us say : two thumbs up!
We would like to recommend this place to any couple, we felt very safe and comfortable!

11834,4647151,2013-05-18,5525432,Lynne,"Serena is a wonderful hostess, and her flat is very comfortable and charming. Very well located in an older part of the city, one can easily walk or catch the bus to go most anywhere. Serena gave us ideas about what to see and do while we were there, and recommended some lovely places to eat. It was great to have such a nice cozy space to return to at the end of a busy day seeing sights. And her mother's treats were delicious. Thank you, Serena!"
11834,4728466,2013-05-22,5527387,Zeeshan,Extremely friendly n warm welcome. Serena is awesome and even took us to local stores for shopping. Her apartment is in the middle of everywhere n very adorable. We also had the pleasure of enjoying cookies made by her mother. Thanks serena!

Although we arrived quite late in the night, Serena warmly welcomed us and graciously  took time to suggest places to go and walking routes to take during our stay. There were also some freshly baked, delicious cookies and honey waiting for us in the room. Getting out of the apartment  landed us in the lovely streets of  Monti with great pizzerias all around which are open late into the night. We had an awesome time in Rome! Tip: Definitely make yourself some coffee using the Italian moka-pot and the coffee powder in the apartment.

It is central, close to transport and shops.
The design and services in the apartment were excellent.
Highly recommended for 2 or 3 adults."

EstÃ¡ situado en el barrio de Monti, en la parte antigua, con mucho caracter, repleto de tiendas de ropa vintage, galerias de arte y restaurantes, muy bien situado, a un paso del Coliseo, y cerca de las atracciones turÃ­sticas mÃ¡s importantes.
Tuvimos una cÃ¡lida bienvenida por parte de Serena, que nos facilitÃ³ informaciÃ³n y nos recomendÃ³ lugares para visitar.

11834,5173072,2013-06-17,97138,Yvonne,"Definitely a charming property - all wood!  very quaint! - in a fantastic location in Rome!  Soooo close to the Colosseum.
Serena is very helpful and lovely with lots of sightseeing suggestions.
When you get out of the Metro station, cross the road to the opposite Metro station and the street is very close.
Lovely area with great little boutique / vintage shops and Piazza della Madonna dei Monti is a great place to hang out!
Despite the bed being softer than I would prefer and a few mosquitoes getting me, it was a lovely place to stay!  
It would be difficult to find a better location in Rome!"
11834,5245376,2013-06-20,6066725,Yelena,"Serena was above and beyond a great host. The apartment had everything we could possibly need during our stay, plus Serena had fresh fruit, milk, and water waiting for us in the fridge and cookies on the table. We were delayed getting to Rome and later locked the keys in the apartment, and Serena was really easy to reach and gracious in waiting for us and coming to let us in. She made our stay in Rome super easy and very pleasant."
11834,5273177,2013-06-22,2416409,Vaughn,"Serena's apartment in Rome is great and Serena is a fantastic host.  Our train was delayed (by over 2 hours) from Florence and Serena still met us at the apartment in the evening when we arrived and took care to explain everything including suggested local tours for our limited stay in Rome.  The apartment is beautifully decorated and Serena left fresh fruit and biscuits for us which was very thoughtful.  A wonderful place to stay, close to the Colosseum and other sights in Rome."
11834,5342656,2013-06-25,2764772,Terry,"Though the flat was small for three of us, it was pleasant and in a really great location. Serena was wonderful and welcoming, offering many good suggestions of places to visit in the area. Her mother had generously made some delicious treats that were waiting for us when we arrived. 

When we had a problem with the hot water, she was extremely responsive and did the absolute best she could to get it resolved as quickly as possible, even though it was the weekend. 

We greatly appreciated her warmth and hospitality. Grazie, Serena!"
11834,5530194,2013-07-04,6602555,Andrew,"Serena's flat was excellent! Perfect location- a short walk to the Colosseum, metro station around the corner, tasty neighborhood restaurants. Serena communicated well, and provided us with many nice suggestions, and even fed us a few of her mother's home baked biscuits- Yum! My favorite part was that the flat felt secluded, even though it's near a busy area. A great place to relax after long days of sight-seeing!"
11834,5639305,2013-07-09,6556251,LaTonya,"My husband and I had a wonderful experience staying in Serena's studio apartment from 4 - 8 July, 2013.  It is located on a quiet street in Rome and within a 10 minute walk to the Colosseum.  The street has great boutique clothing stores, nice restaurants (with free wifi), and a grocery store.  The Cavour metro stop, which is only one stop away from the Termini station, is literally right around the corner.  It was so convenient to get around.  Also around the corner is a piazza with a gorgeous fountain where locals and foreigners alike hang out.
Serena met us at the apartment.  She spend time getting us acqainted with the studio and helping us understand how to get around Rome.  The apartment was on the first floor which was great for us because we had heavy luggage.  The bathroom and shower were spacious, there was a walk-in closet, and the murphy bed was surpisingly comfortable.   There is also a washing machine in the bathroom and a rack provided to dry clothes in the outdoor courtyard.  Be careful where you place the rack.  The guy living above was watering his plants and got our clothes wet.  The apartment was very clean.  Bath and hand towels were provided (but not wash clothes, so you may want to bring your own if you need them).  The previous renters broke the showerhead and Serena immediately let us know that she was going to have it repaired.  It was fixed the same day.   The air conditioning works fabulously.  I was actually cold at times and it was very hot in Rome during our stay.  She also gave us some delicious biscuits that her mother cooked.  The kitchen is fully stocked with cooking and eating utensils, and there was water and other refreshments left for us in the refrigerator.  Overall, this place exceeded our expectations!!  The studio was in a old building and was beautifully and authentically designed.  It was our first airbnb stay and we were very pleased.  If you are thinking of staying here, you won't be diappointed.  Thank you so much Serena!!  "
11834,5970378,2013-07-24,7191134,Trina,"I would recommend everyone who is going to Rome to stay in Serenas wonderful flat. She is the most wonderful host and we were greeted with fruit and lovely homemade biscuits. Serena even took the time on beforehand to tell us how to go to the flat from the airport and as great foodies she helped us with restaurant tips in Rome. The area of Rione Monti is hip, modern and trendy  but still authentic Rome style with traditional trattorias mixed with newer trendy cafes and wine bars. Make sure not to miss nearby 2Periodico CafÃ© at the end of the road with wonderful breakfast and coffee or for homemade and fresh pasta and wonderful food experience, La Carbonara, very close to the flat.Or the Taverna Fori Imperiali run by a kind and welcoming family (try their cacio e pepe pasta with truffles! It is incredible!) I could go on and on but will let you have your own discoverings of the area.

The flat has all amenities, even a walk in closet :-) For shopping Rione Monti has alot of cool shops as well. You will not regret staying here. We went this month of july, where the heat is at its highest but the flat also has AC we couldnt be happier!

Have a fantastic stay in Rome and in Serenas flat! :-)"

We highly recommend.   "

11834,7159011,2013-09-09,4251860,Kelly,"Serena's apartment was so lovely, and in such a great location.  We loved it!  There was a little art show going on across the street the night we arrived, and a tiny plaza full of people enjoying the night and sharing a drink about 100 meters away.  The restaurants in the area were great - not too touristy.  And we stumbled on a funky little fashion market down the street on our last day there.  It was walking distance to the Coliseum and the Trevi Fountain.

The apartment itself was very comfortable for two people.  It was very clean and well-decorated, and Serena's mom had made some delicious cookies to welcome us.  I was a little apprehensive about the sofa bed before we arrived, but it was actually really comfy, and we slept very well.  When we arrived, Serena gave us some great tips on good walks in the city, and even helped us arrange a taxi to get to the airport.

Thank you for being such a welcoming hostess, Serena!  We would love to stay again!"
11834,7829070,2013-10-05,2966272,Monica,"We stayed in Serena's place for two nights at the beginning of October. It was amazing! Serena gave us a lot of great recommendations and the apartment itself is so well put together. Serena has thought of every detail to make you feel at home while in Rome. The apartment is also really close to the major sites, including the Colosseum, and in a very lively area. I would definitely recommend this apartment and would hope to stay here again one day. "
11834,8139391,2013-10-17,6418992,Jesus,The house is really nice and cosy. Always clean and with all what we needed during our stay. The location is just perfect and many things are at just some minutes walking. For two people it is perfect and for three it starts to be a bit tight. Serena was a great host and she gave us some advices for our visit. I really recommend this place if you are planning to visit Rome.
11834,8481600,2013-11-02,3387197,Marco,"I stayed in Rome for two nights, mainly to meet up with friends - couldn't have made a better choice for location - right in the middle of sociable Rione Monti, with tons of great little wine bars, trattorie and restaurants on cobbled streets, yet just a stone's throw away from the madness and wonders of Tourist Rome! 

Serena is a warm, friendly host, full of cool advice on things to do/see - and her flat is superb - tucked away off a small back courtyard, so quiet that you almost can't believe you're in Rome - it's decorated with care, yet also functional, has a great shower (I can't forgive a bad shower!) and a double pull-down bed which is extraordinarily sturdy and comfortable. Serena's extra touches, from her mum's amazing ring shaped biscuits, to coffee and fruit in the fridge for snacking, made me feel well cared for. 

If I have one, and just one TINY word of caution it's this: roaming/internet connection in the flat was almost non-existent. In a sense this could be a godsend for some (getting away from it all, etc)... However, I found myself having to pop into the courtyard to send text messages, upload pics, check maps/wiki etc - only a minor inconvenience as I had lovely weather, but in the colder/wetter season might be a bit of a pain. 
I think Serena is looking into a wi-fi connection which I think would be incredibly useful... 

Regardless of this, I'd still happily stay there again and recommend Serena's flat wholeheartedly!"
11834,8566440,2013-11-05,3375074,Graziella Et Alexis,"We strongly recommend to stay at Serena's appartement, you won't regret it. Serena is full of advices to visit Rome. The flat is well situated to visit Rome, you can see everything without taking metro. The coliseo is just 5 minutes walking. It take 15 minutes walking from the Termini station to join the place. It is easy to find. The only negative point is : there isn't Wifi in the flat. But, The appartement is very nice, spotless and decorated with taste. You have all you need inside. Also she provided us pasta, home made cookies, coffee, tea, fruits... Thank you for all, Serena!"
11834,11515438,2014-04-06,13072729,Natasha,"First of all, I would like to thank Serena for having us ate her flat! 
She welcomed us, helped us with our bags, explained how everything worked in the house, separated maps and tips to give us, indicated excellent restaurants and even left welcome chocolates and biscuits to us. 
The house was perfectly clean and organized!
The location is perfect, we did all the spots by foot!

If I'll go back to Rome, I'm sure that I'll stay at Serena's flat!!

Grazie mille Serena!!"
11834,11649017,2014-04-10,3095776,Clair,Charming is the word for both the apartment and Serena who could not have been more helpful. Lovely place nicely located in the centre but quiet in the apartment - We would happily stay again. Grazie a lot Serena! 
11834,11798402,2014-04-15,12582251,Julie,"Hi Serena, with a little delay we post our comment.
We were in your so beautiful city from last 10 to 14 of april and it was wonderfull!!!
We were well hosted by Massimo ans Susana and received tasty cakes, mhh thanks to your mother :-)
Regarding your flat, it was really well located, quiet and confortable. 
Maybe too dark, but doesn't matter because we were in the city those whole days.
This city area is so nice with many little cafÃ©s and restaurants (Asino d'oro :-) , Piadineria, ... we liked it!

We won't miss to give your adress :-)

We wish you all the best !

See you in Belgium?

11834,12061502,2014-04-22,12532159,Annabelle,"We had e perfect stay in Rome thanks to serena. The appartement is wonderfull ! Fully equiped and really well located : I officially fell in love with Via Del Bochetto, it's little shops and places. We walked easily in every place in Rome. 
Finally, Serena is very nice and so welcoming ! For sure I'll come back ! "
11834,12158654,2014-04-24,13072773,Ivan,"Serena is great host! I mean, really, really, really great! Her hospitality is amazing as well as her desire to help us with anything that we possibly would need. We really enjoyed her mom biscuits (deeeeelicious!!!) and that gesture also tells a lot about her friendliness and warmth. She had very nice and helpful proposals for our city tours and places to eat. You can also sign for the tours that she organizes, but we wanted to experience Rome on our own.

Her place is amazing! It is warm, cozy, cute little apartment, equipped with everything that we needed. Great kitchen, perfect bathroom, and amazing ambiance. Completely Italian experience. :) It is in the very center of the city and most of the sightseeing can be done by walking. 

When (rather than IF) we visit Rome again, Serena's little place will definitively be our choice.  

Jelena & Ivan"
11834,12463273,2014-05-03,13382191,Alex,"I booked this apartment based on reviews, and it definitely lives up to the listing! It's in an awesome part of Rome! Serena is a fabulous host that cares about her guests. I would recommend staying with Serena in Rome. Her suggestions, especially Sora Margarita, in the ghetto, was amazing - awesome dinner! Her mother is an amazing baker. The place is super cozy with a nice sized walk in closet! I loved the neighborhood, perfect location! "

11834,13137051,2014-05-20,13031238,Jemma,"Great studio apartment, great neighbourhood and great host! 

My boyfriend and I stayed for 4 nights in May. The apartment was clean, secure and had everything we needed. All the little touches that Serena had provided really made the difference (e.g. little toiletries, fresh fruit, coffee). The studio is small but very well designed with a comfortable bed. Natural light was a little lacking but lots of lamps and lighting to make up for this.

We loved the local area, lots of cafes, bars and a Piazza at the end of the street where you can grab a  slice of pizza, a drink and sit by the fountain in the evening. 

Serena was full of lots of great suggestions for walks and when to visit certain sights. It really made a difference to our trip.

I canât forget to mention the lovely welcome biscuits from Serenaâs motherâ¦ delicious! 

Only downfall was no Wi-Fi. However, it was probably good for us to really switch off for a few days.

Would love to visit again and would recommended to anyone who wants to be close to the main sites in Rome but in a neighbourhood that still feels authentic.
"
11834,14025420,2014-06-10,13799071,Shannon,"We had a very pleasant experience staying in Serena's apartment! Centrally located by the colosseum, this apartment was in walking distance of all sights we wanted to see. Many worthwhile restaurants right I'm that area! Serena greeted us warmly in the apartment with a map, walking routes, and homemade cookies from her mom! She was readily available with all our questions after check in-very much recommend this experience! "
11834,14181568,2014-06-14,12852251,Robert,Thank you for making our stay in Romeeverything we had hoped for. Your flat was warm and comfortable and the location was ideal.  We set out everyday on foot to explore the city and at the end of the day were happy to get back to your charming oasis in the middle of Rome..
11834,14340896,2014-06-17,11609630,Agnieszka,"We did not have a chance to meet Serena (she had to be at work). She left little gifts for us in the apartment (some things in the fridge, biscuits, sweets), which was very sweet and thoughtfull. Thank you!  The apartment had amazing location - 10 min walk to Colloseum, next to great cafes but still very quiet. It was not very spacious, but very clean, cosy and fully equipped. Bed was very comfy!  It would be great if wifi was there, especially that internet in cafes and restaurants was often very slow. The apartment was very dark, the light had to be on even in the morning - but it was not such a big problem as we spent most of the day outside.We loved Roma and we definitely have to come back!"
11834,14606672,2014-06-23,7414428,Marlee,By far my best air bnb experience. Fell in love with the flat and Serena was so nice and helpful. This experience was one of my favourite things about Rome - Thank you for everything! 
11834,15140064,2014-07-03,15544458,Cortland,"Serena was kind and helpful laying out some day trips in Roma. She had some materials prepared when we arrived showing various routes to see particular landmarks but didn't hesitate to discuss some other possibilities unique to our interests. Overall a very warm and friendly person I think.

The apartment itself was located in a central part of the Monti neighborhood/district in old Rome and was very conveniently located for trips to the Colosseum/Senate or toward Trevi fountain. It was also not far from the main train station (termini)."
11834,15576452,2014-07-12,1832755,Krista,"The apartment was perfect and just as advertised. One of the best apartment rental experiences I have had. The location is perfect. In the middle of a busy and hip neighborhood, easy walking all over Rome. We were able to walk everywhere - no cabs, buses or trains for us. Despite this, the apartment faces an internal courtyard and was VERY quiet and peaceful. Such a rare and wonderful balance in the middle of the city. We had a small issue during our stay and Serena was very quick to respond.  As other reviewers said, the apartment is dark (no natural light) but we didn't mind at all. Also, there is no WiFi, but there were several restaurants and cafes on the block that offered free wifi so we were able to dine there once and then quickly check our email as we walked by on our way to our next destination. It really wasn't a problem for us at all. We highly recommend this apartment! "
11834,19779833,2014-09-18,693042,Lucas & Adrienne,"Serena made us feel especially welcome our first time in Rome. She gave us great recommendations for nearby restaurants that locals love and took the time to show us walking routes to all the necessary sites. Oh and she even left us with coffee and biscuits her mom made. I've never had a host be so sweet and helpful. 

The studio is in the best location. Monti is a very charming neighborhood with small streets and great shops. It's close enough to the central train station to walk there. It's practically next to the forum yet hidden from the crowds,  We loved that the studio was quiet and dark to catch up on much needed sleep. 

Be sure to check out the cafe across the street for the best cappuccinos in Rome and free wifi."
11834,20014868,2014-09-22,18713794,Igor,"This lovely and cozy apartment is situated near the historical center of the city but at the same time it is very quiet and safe. The apartment is very clean and so well-decorated that we spent a lot of time just enjoying its creative and relaxing atmosphere (and welcoming cake from Serenaâs mother :)).
Serena is a great host, she amazed us with friendliness and hospitality. She had a lot of materials and tips for us to find something special in this vast city. Also Serena spent a lot of time helping us to choose the best sights and museums for the first acquaintance with Rome. Thanks to her recommendations we went to Domus Romane and it was one of the most impressive experiences in our little trip.
Lack of morning light and wi-fi are the only cons. But for us it was not a big problem.
Grazie mille, Serena! :)"
11834,20488596,2014-09-30,12632113,Vera,"We were lucky to stay at Serena's appartment which is located in the heart of Rome! The studio is big enough and very stylish! There are so many little charming accessories that made this studio so comfortable for living. I can't help admiring a bidet in the barthroom! The ""Charming Boschetto House"" is really charming and cosy!!! It isn't only the name!
We could reach all famouse landmarks of Rome by foot . The location of the appartment is perfect to feel Rome. There are many nice cafes and small restaurants around the house where we ate in the evenings. There is a supermarket near the house along Boschetto street, where we bought food for breakfast. Everything was very convenient! 
Serena is very hospitable and helpful! She arranged a transfer airport-Boschetto house -Torvojanica-airport by car for us and gave us necessary recommendation concerning sight-seeings. She really takes care about her guests! We felt it everwhere: before the trip, at the first meeting at her appartment and in Tarvojanica where we finished our rest. I think only she presents a home made cake on the arrival!!! It was very pleasant and tasty!
By the way I recommend you to prolong your rest on the sea-side near Rome at Serena's appartment in Torvajanica. We enjoyed Rome and after that we had a wonderful rest on the sea-side with sandy beaches. 
Dear Serena, our trip was fantastic owing to you! Many thanks for your care and kindness!!! We wish to visit you one more time and, of course, to spend in Torvayanica more days, renting a car.
It was a great pleasure for us to meet you!
Hope to see you one day in Moscow!
With kind regards,

Vera and Yury

11834,21026924,2014-10-10,16525267,Phoebe,"Serena was very welcoming. She spent lots of time with us giving guidance on how to get the best out of our stay. Her restaurant recommendations were top. The area seemed the best place to stay in Rome if you love food. Top delis, gelato and trattorias all frequented by Italians. The apartment is very stylish and had everything we needed."
11834,24704062,2015-01-02,20414340,Joseph,"The stay was exactly what my girlfriend and I needed. It's only a short walk away from the collesseum, everything is within walking distance, shops, pizzerias, restaraunts, etc. It was a cozy place with everything we needed. Serena is willing to give you advice on what to do and see while you're there as well as where to eat if you have any questions. "
11834,27411201,2015-03-03,21494519,Enrico,"Partendo da Serena, estremamente disponibile e gentile, arrivando all'appartamento, tutto perfetto! Monti Ã¨ un quartiere splendido, un piccolo mondo racchiuso in se stesso, e l'appartamento Ã¨ qualcosa di meraviglioso. Piccolo ma accogliente e dotato di qualsiasi cosa uno possa aver bisogno. Io mi sono letteralmente innamorato di questa casa e spero di poterci tornare in futuro. Grazie ancora di tutto, a presto.

11834,28358675,2015-03-22,10728956,Cristina,"Siamo arrivati a Roma prima dell'orario concordato con Serena e lei Ã¨ stata molto disponibile ad anticipare il check in pur non abitando/lavorando vicino all'appartamento di via del Boschetto.
La sua disponibilitÃ  e accoglienza sono state favolose, il suo sorriso ci ha accolti all'arrivo insieme alla sua puntualitÃ  nel descriverci il quartiere e nel darci consigli su cosa vedere, dove mangiare, che strade fare per avere una visione completa della citta'. I buonissimi biscotti fatti dalla sua mamma lasciati in omaggio ci hanno rasserenato le sveglie all'alba e dato l'energia per le lunghe camminate.
L'appartamento Ã¨ molto bello, pulito ed ordinato cosÃ¬ come si puÃ² vedere dalle foto, un vero gioiellino nel cuore della cittÃ  antica.
Il quanrtiere Monti Ã¨ un quartiere bellissimo e via del Boschetto ne costituisce la via principale, ricca di piccole negozietti che spaziano dall'abbigliamento all 'antiquariato/design.
In questo quartiere si puÃ² essere per qualche giorno ""turisti non turisti"" ....romani d'adozione , non essendo u quartiere molto turistico ti permette infatti di vivere a pieno la vera Roma"
11834,28613439,2015-03-27,25266882,Kelvin,"Serena, your place was wonderful! Thank you for letting us stay in your flat. The place was as advertised, nice and cozy.

11834,29971477,2015-04-15,21036064,Anthony,Serena gave us a very warm welcome when we arrived. She made some excellent restaurant suggestions and told us everything we needed to know about the flat. The flat is exactly like in the pictures and is perfectly located for everything you would like to see in Rome. Highly recommended. 
11834,30383657,2015-04-21,27222879,Jodi,"Serena was an excellent host and the apartment was amazing!  We stayed in April, 2015 for 3 nights and were very satisfied.  Serena gave us perfect directions, greeted us with a smile and gave us all the information we needed.  She even had a bed setup for our daughter and gave her a gift as she was turning 1 year old during our visit.  The apartment is perfectly located and within walking distance to all attractions.  Beautifully decorated, all necessary amenities, cozy, comfortable, just perfect.  If we ever are lucky enough to return to Rome, we will be looking into this apartment again.  She was even in the process of getting wifi setup at the apartment, which we were fortunate to be able to use during our stay. If you are planning a trip to Rome, I strongly recommend considering this apartment.  "
11834,31047299,2015-05-01,21294682,Jean Jack,"Appartement tout Ã©quipÃ© comme decrit sur les photos.
Serena nous a bien accueilli malgrÃ© l'heure tardive, il y a avait un gateau et des chocolats en guise d'accueil.
l'appartement est tres bien situÃ©, dans un endroit calme mais pas de chance nous avons eu qq travaux dans la cour interieure a une heure matinale durant 2j...
seul bÃ©mol, l'appartement sentait l'humiditÃ© et le renfermÃ©, cela a du Ãªtre majorÃ© par le temps pluvieux qu'on avait eu peut Ãªtre. "
11834,32466506,2015-05-18,28296162,Nazia,"My husband and I stayed at Serenaâs condo for 3 nights in May.  I have to admit this was one of the best parts of our trip.  We felt at home.  The condo was clean, smelled great, had great amenities, was centrally located, and the list goes on.  Serena was definitely an added bonus.  Her kind and warm personality was amazing.  She greeted us with her motherâs homemade doughnuts, which were scrumptious! She also brought us a map of Rome and spent 15 minutes or so giving us recommendations on dining options and the must see places.  She kept us in the loop about everything! She even reserved a private car for us to take to the airport.  We literally feel that we lucked out with Serena.  Hands down, my husband and I plan on staying at Serenaâs the next time we visit. We love you Serena! Thank you for everything!!"
11834,33378306,2015-05-27,9555106,Andrew,"Serena's flat is a fantastic choice for experiencing Rome--and Monti--and we would gladly return. Quiet, charming, and perfectly located, the flat is a stone's throw from the Colloseum and St Peter in Chains, and even closer to vintage clothing shops and fine restaurants and bars. This is a real find!"
11834,34316334,2015-06-07,11538636,Jakob,"Serena warmly welcomed us and was flexibel with our relatively early arrival. She explained us about the city and left some delicious cookies for us. Great start. 
The apartment is superb located in Monti and is nicely designed. We really liked it there. 
Thumbs up!! Perfect!!!"
11834,36036070,2015-06-24,30250643,Greg,Serena's apartment was in a terrific location. 5 minute walk to the underground subway and to many attractions. She was very nice and knowledgeable about Rome and helped my fiancÃ© and I set up two tours. Not to mention calling a cab to pick us up at 4am the day we were leaving! Thanks so much for your hospitality!  
11834,36688854,2015-06-30,12533515,June,Serena's apartment was cozy and welcoming. Serena wasn't in Rome during our stay but was responsive throughout the entire booking. Serena's friend Hassan welcomed us and showed us the place. We arrived a little late and he accommodated us no problem. The apartment is as pictured and was nice and clean. The best part about Serena's place is the location. The neighborhood is in such a great part of Rome and walking distance to the colosseum. There are great cafÃ©s and restaurants within the block and vintage clothing shops right across the street. 
11834,37215280,2015-07-05,13141099,Christie,"Serena was great! She answered all of our questions that we had before arriving and also gave us so much more extra information when we arrived. She provided a map of the city for us upon arrival. We arrived late into the night around 10pm and had to pay a late check-in fee, but she was able to arrange a taxi ride for us from the airport for a fee. The home is just as described and seen in the pictures listed on airbnb. The home had all the things you would need. The A/C worked well with the hot weather. The location was great. It was located just 5 min from the colosseum/palatine hill. It's also really close to a metro station if you want to travel that way. The wifi is a portable wifi gadget that you can carry around with you, but make sure it's charged all the way and turn it off when not in use because the battery can be used up pretty quickly. Tip for guests: if you use the wifi at the home, then make sure it's placed outside in the patio. There doesnt seem to be good connection when the gadget is placed inside the home. We really enjoyed Rome while staying at this home and would definitely come again to this home if we return to Rome! Thank you Serena!"
11834,37898804,2015-07-11,34672852,Lisa,"This flat is a wonderful home base for a visit to Rome. The neighborhood is charming, quiet, yet filled with great places to eat and shop. Serena is such a warm hostess. She provided perfect recommendations and is genuinely excited to share her home city. My only tiny disappointment was that the courtyard is interior and dark, not really designed for relaxing. But there are so many places to sit with a book or a coffee in Rome it didn't really matter. The flat is very clean and comfortable. I would happily stay again. "
11834,40337322,2015-07-30,35693352,Jose Luis,"El apartamento es acogedor, amueblado con todos los elementos que se pueden necesitar. AdemÃ¡s Serena nos preparÃ³ una cesta con fruta y un paquete con galletas caseras para darnos la bienvenida. Serena es una buena anfitriona, cuando llegamos ya tenÃ­a puesto el aire acondicionado para que estuviÃ©ramos frescos y nos recibiÃ³ con mÃºsica de Jazz. Nos trajo un mapa de Roma y pasÃ³ un rato dÃ¡ndonos recomendaciones sobre restaurantes y los lugares de visita obligada. El apartamento estÃ¡ muy bien situado  en una zona de moda, con pequeÃ±as tiendas de diseÃ±o y buenos restaurantes.  El apartamento estÃ¡ mirando a un patio interior, con lo que no se oye nada de la calle. TambiÃ©n estÃ¡ cerca de los monumentos mÃ¡s importantes y cerca de la parada de metro Cavour, por lo que lo convierte en una buena base para visitar Roma. Nosotros hemos pasado unos dÃ­as maravillosos en Roma. Fuimos con nuestra pequeÃ±a bebÃ© Noa y Serena se ocupÃ³ de que en el apartamento tuviÃ©ramos una cuna de viaje para facilitarnos la estancia. "
11834,45187974,2015-08-31,4124431,Amanda,"We absolutely loved our stay in the Charming Boschetto House! All correspondence was prompt, the check-in was seamless, and the location was perfect! We felt at home right away. Serena was a delight to speak with and messaged us after we settled in to make sure everything was OK. There are numerous restaurants and cafes nearby and most tourist sights are within walking distance. The train station is also quite close which we found very helpful. The apartment itself is adorable, safe and had a great air conditioner which we were very grateful for. We would definitely stay again. Thank you Serena! "
11834,47035940,2015-09-15,35109243,Alex,"Serena was an awesome host with an incredibly located and well kept property in Monti, Rome. The flat was charming and beautifully situated- even though you were only a 5-10 minute walk from the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Trajan's Forum, you felt like you were in a small, local village in a totally different part of Italy. You were also a 2-3 minute walk to a Metro station that was on the Termini line. Great restaurants and boutiques surrounded the apartment and were literally around the corner. I couldn't think of a better location to stay if anyone ever wanted to visit Rome.

Serena was incredibly helpful and gracious, making herself available to us upon our arrival to familiarize us to the area and the apartment. Her WiFi router was extremely helpful, as we were able to take it with us to use GPS to prevent getting lost. 

A great location that I would recommend to any couple or single person traveling to Rome!"
11834,48506247,2015-09-27,23032417,Robert,"Serena was an A+ host and the apartment was wonderful! Only a 5 minute walk from the coliseum, Roman forum, and palatine hill made it super easy for us to enjoy the sights. Roma termini station is even within walking distance (if you don't want to take the tube or a bus). Serena offered us some great dinner suggestions, and even helped arrange our cab to the airport on our last day! Highly recommend!"
11834,49313984,2015-10-03,15066832,Tim,"Serena is fantastic! She waited for us till 6pm although she was late to go shutter her studio (work).

Serena gave us a map with advice on where to eat, and places to visit.

We loved our stay at Boschetto House. The place actually looks better than in the pictures. It was a quiet apartment with everything we needed and in a fantastic location.

The apartment is only a 5-min walk to the Cavour Metro, and from there you can head off anywhere. The Colosseum is really near, under 10 min. walk?

Monti is a lovely old quarter, where there are all manner of quaint shops and eateries. We ate out all 3 evenings in the same area.

We surely won't mind staying at the Boschetto House again."

11834,52017380,2015-10-25,38225238,Robert,Many thanks to Serena. We only had two days in rome but Serena told us about many places to visit. So we easily could have stayed for another week. Her place is as nice so that we actually thought about extending our stay. A quiet place in the middle of Monti! 
11834,55483835,2015-12-01,49030888,Mauro,"E' stata la nostra prima esperienza con Airb&b ed Ã¨ stata perfetta.
L'appartamento Ã¨ arredato con cura e pulito. La posizione Ã¨ ideale per visitare Roma a piedi.
Abbiamo soggiornato con la nostra bimba di 10 mesi e Serena ci ha messo a disposizione un lettino e un sacco di giochini oltre a darci diversi consigli sulla visita della cittÃ .

11834,74958324,2016-05-17,52870501,Ashley,Serena's place was absolutely wonderful. Located in the city center it was just minutes to some of Rome's most historic sites and authentic restaurants. Serena went above and beyond to make my husband and I feel at home. She was readily available to communicate and made sure every detail was taken care of. Her flat was extremely clean and homey. Her mother even made us some delicious biscuits. I will be recommending Serena's place to any of friends and family who travel to Rome. A truly wonderful experience thanks to a wonderful host!
11834,75788381,2016-05-23,71013211,Brandon,Great location! Short walk to the Colosseum and great bars and restaurants within footsteps of the front door. Serena was very helpful and provided a lot of great suggestions for our short stay in Rome. The room is small but has everything you need. It faces an interior courtyard so there is no street noise.
11834,78245107,2016-06-06,36634201,AleÅ¡,"We had a great experience in Serena's place in Rome.
She was very helpful prior our arrival and also during ""check in/out"".
The apartment itself is very nice, well equipped and clean with nice (Website hidden by Airbnb) is slightly higher humidity as the house is cry historical. Great location few minutes walk to all sights - still with Italian atmosphere at the close square with fountain.
Serena, thanks a lot for your hospitality. Ales"

Right in the centre of Rome, walking distance to Colosseum, Forum Romanum, Trajan's column and many other antique sites. Metro station next corner and small supermarket in the street. Many nice restaurants and small artist shops in this quarter. The flat is situated in the backyard of a historical house, nicely restored and a total calm place to give shelter from the busy roman streets. Serena was very helpful and collected many useful hints and material for her guests. Absolutely outstanding!"
11834,108402276,2016-10-16,4911578,Martin,Had a great stay at Serena's. Location is optimal to visit Rome and it was very easy to communicate with our host. 
11834,109250655,2016-10-20,13846652,Chalita Momo,"The apartment is very furnished. The sofa unit hides a full size fold up bed. There's moka pots and coffee ground available. The location is in Monti central, a very lovely neighborhood. Note that the internet is available through pocket wifi, the signal can be weak on a cloudy day but it's not a big deal for us at all. . We had a very comfortable stay. "
11834,124581465,2017-01-02,39559141,Jinmeng,"This studio is fantastic. The location is perfect, that we could go everywhere by walking, which is convenient to have a great view of this incredible city. We could also find several amazing restaurants and bars in the neighborhood thanks to the detailed instruction of Serena. The room is clean and fully equipped. It's really like your own cozy home. "

11834,146308878,2017-04-22,45930252,Becca,Serena has a beautiful apartment in Rome. It was a short and easy walk to most of the sights. It is also very close to the metro. Although the apartment is in the city it almost seems like you are in the country once you are inside. It is very quiet and has a nice courtyard. Serena had a crib set up for our daughter and even had a few toys. It was a great few days.

Many restaurants in walking distance and the Colosseum was literally around the corner.  Serena was very helpful in checking us in and orienting us to the location.  Her mom even left biscuits for us which were delicious!   The apartment has a nice layout and courtyard--we really liked that it was on the first floor too.  If you like Indian food, suggest Indian Affairs right around the corner!!  Get there early though.  We loved our stay here and would recommend to others!"
11834,159439581,2017-06-11,113723049,Bethany,"The stay at Serena's was amazing! The room is cute and clean. Some food is provided as well as soaps. Serena is very personal and has many good suggestions. If there is an option offered to have dinner with her, take it! The food is the best we had in Rome!"
11834,162523662,2017-06-21,3742691,Daniel,"Well located, clean ground floor unit with a fold down (very comfortable) bed. Serena was an excellent communicator and always available. We had a great stay, thank you"
11834,205510749,2017-10-22,50350948,Luc,Le logement de Serena est trÃ¨s confortable et parfaitement situÃ©.
11834,251611058,2018-04-08,163155584,Massimo,"Alloggiare da Serena Ã¨ stata un esperienza fantastica. Lei si Ã¨ dimostrata gentilissima, ci ha fatto sentire come a casa nostra. Ci ha dato molti consigli su come ""vivere"" in un paio di giorni. L'appartamento Ã¨ ad un passo dalla metro, pulito e ha tutto il necessario."
11834,256581872,2018-04-23,130650336,Nicholas,"Location, location, location. Place is a grotto reprieve in an amazing location in Rome. If your willing to walk about 20-30 minutes your within walking distance to the whole town, which I highly recommend. Neighborhood has a great feeling. He square around the corner is one of the coolest things I experienced in Rome. All the locals are just hanging out drinking beer around 7ish just living the good life. All of Rome is crowded but the area around the apartment feels like itâs crowded with the right type of people."
11834,262308423,2018-05-08,91619831,Gregory,"A great place, ideally located and a great host that provides good advice as well as a charming house!"
11834,263905214,2018-05-13,13505582,Dan,"Our host Serena was very helpful with tips and suggestions for touring not only Rome, but other cities as well.  The place is on the bottom floor of a building and the windows face into the courtyard so it does stay somewhat dark unless the lights (off which, there are many) are on.  Wifi/cellular hotspot signal is tough to get unless you put the device just outside the windowsill or just take it with you.  There's enough space for two in the studio and the restroom is pretty large compared to every other place we stayed in Italy.  The location of the place is really great.  It's in a very cool neighborhood with tons of options for dining and it's very close to the main attractions.  If you're looking to be out and about, this makes a great base to explore central Rome and it's pretty convenient having a place to drop off stuff or refresh before the next excursion of the day."
11834,266143934,2018-05-19,88645876,Ben,"We had a great stay in Rome at Serena's place, it is located in a great neighbourhood a short stroll away from the Colosseum. We were also welcomed with delicious homemade biscuits! Would highly recommend. Would note that although WiFi is indicated as a service provided, the additional info states this is a supplementary service, and we did not have reliable WiFi during our stay, so bear this in mind if you are needing WiFi."
11834,267603230,2018-05-22,117352986,Jessica,Our stay in Rome with Serena was great! She set up the check in well in advance of our stay and was easy to communicate with. The apartment was clean and had a lot of character. Serena gave us restaurants and things to do around Rome. She even gave us some biscuits her mom had made! Overall we loved our stay!
11834,272244664,2018-06-03,178726402,Dan,"Serena is such a great host. She is so attentive to your needs and does the small things to make your stay feel special. The apartment is clean and has been renovated beautifully. A few things to note: Because the apartment is on the bottom floor of a larger complex, our cell phones had no service inside the apartment. Also, the WiFi is cellular based, which also had little to no reception until we took it into the courtyard. The location is awesome."
11834,277891778,2018-06-17,63729438,Yuyu,"The house is right near the Cavour underground station, its very easy to reach every tourist place, there are many ristorante nearby and the house inside is very quite. Serena prepared us cute cookies and the house style is warm. Thank you for having us again Serena."

 a estadia, sÃ³ acho bom avisar que o ap nÃ£o pega sinal de 3G e o wifi nÃ£o Ã© grande coisa. Fora isso, foi Ã³timo. "
11834,282118576,2018-06-26,2000613,Helena,The location of this cute apartment can not be beat. So many grear restaurants and cute stores near and a stone's throw from the major Rome sights! Serena is lovely and gives you a warm welcome. The internet is patchy in the apartment although Serena does her best to accomodate with the thick walls of the apartment! 
11834,292134694,2018-07-17,44391630,Xiang,Serenaâs place is very adorable and in perfect location where you can basically walk to every places. And Serena is a very helpful and hospital host offering many advice for visiting the city! The only thing is that the WiFi is a little bit too slow sometimes. Anything else is perfect!
11834,322116333,2018-09-12,2323411,Caesare,"Everything was perfect! Serena is a professional and kind host with lots of great tips for an incredible Rome experience. Amazing communication, directions, etc. Serene went above and beyond to provide us with the information to make our late night arrival smooth and easy. We will come back and stay at the Boschetto House!"
11834,325995688,2018-09-21,95967470,Jill,"This place was perfect for my husband and I for the 3days we were visiting Rome. The location is perfect- we could easily walk everywhere, lots of good cafes nearby, and it was quiet and safe. Serena is an excellent host- she had many tips for us and really cared about our stay. The cupboards were stocked with teas and coffee and she even left fruit and biscuits for us. I highly recommend this apartment! Thank you to Serena!"
11834,327667392,2018-09-24,18287726,Liz,"We spent three nights at Serenaâs apartment in Rome and loved the experience overall!

Pros:
-The location is awesome, central walking distance to most of what youâd want to see in Rome
-If you like older architecture, the building is really spectacular and dates back to the 1600âs, I believe.  There is also a nice shared courtyard
-There are nice touches from Serena that we enjoyed: coffee for espresso in the morning, homemade biscuits as well as some fruit in the fridge
-Nice to have a clothes washer in the unit
-The portable WiFi unit was also super helpful for getting access to the web since we didnât have international plans on our phones
-Serena provided lots of recommendations and suggestions on where to go and what to see and eat, which was very much appreciated!

Cons:
-This is a really old building with super thick walls and the unit only has one window, so ventilation is scarce. This makes the apartment a bit damp (i.e. my towel never fully dried after a shower) and there is a bit of a musty smell to the place. Not a huge deal but may be an issue for someone with allergies."
11834,328876140,2018-09-27,77893493,Andrew,"Serena was so attentive and sweet. She and her hostess-in-training, Valentina, were utterly charming. The courtyard was nice, essential for the WiFi service. But I think the crowning glory of the flat is its location. For two important reasons. One is the neighborhood itself. Chock-a-block with quaint shops and eateries it is as close to being a local you can get without hiring movers. The second very important reason is it is central to all the sights you wish to see in Rome. For the intrepid, I would even say walking distance. Thank you, Serena for being such a warm host. I will recommend your flat to anyone I know who will travel to Rome."
11834,329636285,2018-09-29,211572324,Marcia,"Thank you so much for sharing your flat or say a perfect place to stay away from your own home. It literally had everything you need to make
Your stay perfect. Location, the wonderful check in, let us know
Of some fantastic places to see that we wouldnât have done so without Serena letting us know. Washing machine came handy for
Ya too. The fun surprises she left us like water, bowl of fruit, yummy cookies and treats. Such a cozy place to stay and so close to the Coliseum, Trevi and Parthenon. Thanks again Marci & Cory âUtahâ"
11834,331247652,2018-10-02,199983138,Sarah,"This studio is so close to everything! On a charming street, secure and quiet, within walking distance to so much. My mom and I used the Murphy bed and a twin sized cot. We set the cot up in a walk-in closet, it fit great for one person and gave us a little privacy. The space was a little musty, but not enough to bother my sensitive and asthmatic mother. The window was able to black out and let us sleep remarkably well after a long travel day. All the things were provided: soaps, hair dryer, kitchen stuff, cold water and fruit in the fridge, umbrellas, maps, and lots of suggestions for things to see/do/eat. We walked to the flat from Termini- maybe should have gotten a cab for my mom - but she was a champ and it was a nice walk. We felt safe, comfortable and connected - and really enjoyed our time in Rome."

11834,339912781,2018-10-22,210819493,Michele,I highly recommend the Charming Boschetto House! Serena is a lovely and a gracious host. Great location and a warm and cozy home. In walking distance of the main attractions.  Rome is beautiful and we look forward to our next visit.
11834,343077097,2018-10-30,189343956,Tanya,The location is exelent... Serena is nice... If a problem accures during the stay she takes care of it... There was a problem during our stay regarding air condishioning in the appartment and she was quick to solve it and give us a refund
11834,344996700,2018-11-04,7859483,Pree,"I highly recommend staying at Serena's place. It is a gorgeous apartment in a very beautiful part of Rome, just literally a stones throw from the major tourist attractions. Just walking the streets around the apartment will land you upon some absolute gems, restaurants, vintage shops, etc. Serena was extremely helpful with tips about the local area and tourist attractions. The place had a beautiful decor and was very safe. It was an absolute highlight of our trip. Only two minor issues to note, one is hot water runs out quickly, so ensure you have 5 min or less showers and due to the thick walls of the apartment, wifi connection is a bit hit and miss."
11834,366132663,2019-01-02,159132134,Jesus Hector,This apartment has an awesome location. Minutes and walking distance to the ancient sites. Serena is an excellent host. Responds quickly.

If you don't know Rione Monti you should go there. Peter"
11834,440838195,2019-04-21,210827475,Elle,"Serena made us feel incredibly welcome and gave fantastic advice on points of interest and restaurants. The apartment is beautiful and is in a great central location with short walks to every attraction we wanted to see! The personal touches were also greatly appreciated and made our stay very special.

5 stars, we will definitely be returning when we come back to Rome in the future!"

11834,452558380,2019-05-13,94846700,Robin,"This apartment was a great location and a very nice space for our 5 night stay in Rome.   You are an 8 minute walk from the Colosseum!   And you are staying where other Italians live and work......I loved that.  There was a fun impromptu Italian party on the weekend about a 3-4 minute walk from the entry way, at a small piazza with a fountain.  Lots of little eateries and gelato on your street, with the Metro station a very convenient 4 minute walk from the apartment.  I never felt uncomfortable walking around here, even late at night by myself (woman in her 50's).  I really enjoyed the vibe of this area.......there weren't any souvenir shops here!  The apartment is well stocked for cooking, which we did quite a bit.  Really enjoyed the art, the small touches, loved the bathroom tile.  A nice shower.  Your apartment is quiet, although you can hear a bit of street noise sometimes, but as we almost never got to bed before midnight there wasn't too much of that.  The most wonderful thing is how helpful Serena is!  She made our stay so much more enjoyable, with those suggestions that only a local that really loves her city can give.  I felt like there was a helping hand out there if we ever really needed it, and went to a couple of wonderful things I would never have found without her.  Thank you Serena, we appreciate all your friendly help!   We loved our time in Rome.......Ciao!  Ross and Robin"

We loved the area the studio was in and would love to come back again. She gave us homemade biscuits, pasta and jam and it was so good. So nice of her. We can highly recommend this little cozy place to everyone who wants to go to lovely Rome. Sending our love. Kat and Dina <3"
11834,464638909,2019-06-06,60641061,Anna,"The studio is in an incredibly convenient location and is very unique. It was cool inside and in the courtyard despite the heat, the amenities (including coffee and fruit) were special touches. As mentioned in other comments, the internet/wifi is unreliable so donât leave too much planning to the last minute! But who needs internet when you have such a good spot to explore Rome for yourself."
11834,471203569,2019-06-17,6567218,Anders,"I would definitely recommend Serena's place for your stay in Rome. It is very centrally placed for sightseeing, having great local food and drinks, and is close to the Cavore subway station which can you take you throughout the city."
11834,472774298,2019-06-20,46334358,Frank,"Serena  is the best Airbnb host; nonetheless, restaurants, shopping, and metro are within a short walk."

11834,477942378,2019-06-29,260275457,Enrico,Great location and charming studio apartment. Ten to 15 minute walk to the major attractions.  Serena was an excellent host who gave us very helpful information on local sights and restaurants.
11834,481126802,2019-07-04,146190469,Michael,"Excellent location and super clean place!  Only a 10 minute walk to the Colosseum - plenty of restaurants and shopping around for convenience.  Host met us in person, provided great local tips and gave us home made cookies!  I would definitely stay here again."
11834,527580503,2019-09-11,9771183,Yannick,"Location is perfect and Serena's friend was very welcoming.
The flat is really clean and beautiful  and perfect to visit Roma. The metro is 2 min of walking away from the flat which is really helpfull.
1 thing to improve could be the wifi which is a vodafone routeur working 50% of the time and Serena's rule to use it for researches only.Ok.
Otherwise everything is great."
11834,531318037,2019-09-17,51224018,Zuan,"What you see in the picture, itâs 10x better. 

Such a beautiful, clean and spacious home. 

Serena is like a big sister who welcomes, care and guide you about Rome. She took the time and chat with us to ensure we will have a great stay. 

The location is amazing. 5 minutes walk to Colosseo, Roman Forum, Palatine hill. The walk is amazing. 

You are at Monti, one of the oldest town in Rome. Plenty of restaurants and shops of local artisan and designers. 

It is also walking distance to trevie fountain (about 1.5km) and the walk passes by a piazza that overlooks Vatican City and it is out favourite stop at night with a gelato in hand. Here lies our fav pizza place - piccolo buco (must go) 

You can walk to Spanish steps from trevie fountain and take the train from Spagna to Cavour which will lead you back home. Cavour to home is about 3mins walk. 

Talk about accessibility, this place is it! 

I love the wardrobe room which can fit 2 big luggage and 2 small cabin bag. 

Thereâs a tv for night watch, fully functional kitchen where I do my Italian coffee from the moka pot. 

The toilet is great, spacious. The hot water works well & the water pressure is good. Thereâs a washer too if you want! 

We like how Romanâs separate their trash and Serena will teach you that. 

Coming back after a days adventure, Serena home is cozy and the bed is solid and smells so good. 

Thank you Serena. You made Rome a home for us. 

Love, 
Zuan and Hafiz

11834,544458718,2019-10-10,78898061,Aziza,Amazing hospitality and Serena is such a warm positive person! The place is super cozy and has got it all.
11834,546206876,2019-10-13,52072766,Kam,Everything is well thought and well executed. All details exceeding my expectation. Location is super nice. Would have been perfect if WiFi were taken cared of with the same level of attention. Good place if you donât need to get connected on the internet after a hard dayâs sightseeing.
11834,551236710,2019-10-20,66060513,Alvaro,The place is in the heart of Rome. It is a cozy and little apartment. Everything were really clean. There is no mobile phone signal however Selena has a portable WiFi which can be used if you needed it. The cookies from Selenaâs mum were delicious.
11834,555165019,2019-10-27,130579478,Gloria,Soggiorno delizioso. Grazie Serena!
11834,587672024,2020-01-03,10940982,Anna,"Serenaâs little studio in Monti is the perfect place to stay in Rome! The street and the area is beautiful and lively with great cafes and restaurants. Itâs easy to get from studio to Termini and around in the city by foot. 
Serena is truly an amazing host - so kind and welcoming. She gave us great tips for both sightseeing and places to eat and none of them disappointed. 
I can highly recommend staying at Serenaâs place and we will definitely come back!"
12398,121937,2010-10-18,256902,Samuel,"Gea was a wonderful host, she helped with information getting around Rome the apt is beautiful very clean well equipped and minutes from central Rome by tram a block away. The area is like upper west side NYC many shops nice  people. Stay there you won't  be disappointed. Sam Miami"
12398,125335,2010-10-24,113360,Debra,"We really loved staying at Gea's place in Flaminio. A very nice safe leafy district with all the delicious food products you need right outside the door, as well as a selection of great reasonable priced restaurants. The tram is 2 minutes walk and goes straight in to the city centre. If you need a bus to Termini station it is one minute walk from the door. Gea has prepared the apartment with care and consideration. It is very comfortable - cosy and deluxe. Evertything is of a high quality and there is plenty of toilet paper ( a rarity on our European travels)!! Gea is an interesting, warm and lovely person and helped us enormously with hints on how to have a great time in her city. We would highly recommend Gea's apartment. Thanks Gea! We hope to see you again either in Perth or if we are lucky enough to come to Rome again. Deb and Howie, Western Australia October 2010."
12398,132894,2010-11-03,85238,Tahnee & Michael,"Great apartment. Clean, amazingly comfortable bed and nice linen. Very spacious, Gea was a gracious host and can speak english. Even though it isn't in the centre of the city, it is close and very easy to get to on the tram. We enjoyed being in a non-touristy area but still so close."
12398,165704,2011-01-04,58383,Miguel,"Very pleasant apartment in residential area. Comfortable furniture and electrical equipment (e.g. tv, stereo...) of good quality. Gea was very friendly and helpful."
12398,197687,2011-03-13,362286,Federico,"Gea was a great host.
Her apartment is very well decorated, clean and in a very quiet neighborhood. She made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our staying in Rome.
I definitely recommend her apartment and I'll make sure to check if it is available the next time I am going to Rome."
12398,228599,2011-04-17,372625,Urs,"It was just great to be in Casa Donatello in a quiet roman neighborhood. Gea is a wonderful host, and we are looking forward to see her again!"
12398,243573,2011-04-28,486905,Susan,"Gea is truly an **AMAZING** lady! She is just as nice as she is beautiful, gracious, kind, and fun. She is a new acquaintance whom I hope will become a very good friend. I have already offered her to come to Texas for a stay.

The 5 star rating above does not do justice to the spectacular and comfortable accommodations or the lovely, safe, and wonderful neighborhood surrounding the apartment. There is a double door in the building for security and a regular doorman at the front. An elevator is also available, but unnecessary because the apartment is only one half flight of stairs up. 

One of the most desirable features of the apartment is the location to so many areas of Rome, but more specifically to the local bus to the tram -- both within 30 seconds from the bus stop [literally 40 yards from Gea's apartment door], to 1.5 minute walk to the tram at the opposite end of the block [which is about 100 meters].

The bright clean kitchen has all the equipment of any new, modern kitchen space today. In the living room there are all the electronic goodies which most American homes have, and Gea has been gracious enough to share her Wi-Fi service with her apartment renters! How awesome is that?!! FANTASTIC! The roomy bathroom is perfect for anyone and outshines any of the luxury hotels with the beautiful Travertine Italian marble, a huge shower-head, pedestal sink and there is even a bidet, along with the commode.

The apartment was well appointed with everything one could ever need for the duration of their stay. Gea has thought of EVERYTHING and spared no expense to make the environment as relaxing and enjoyable and better than any place at 4 or 5 times the cost! Gea has a great eye for detail and has personally added some of her own beautiful and original artworks to the apartment. 

I was in heaven and I really had a terrific time in Casa Donatello! I know I will stay there again, if the apartment is available. From beginning to end the experience was PERFECTION. I really hated to leave....but I had to get back to pay for my next vacation! Don't miss the chance to stay here, you will not regret the decision, and you will see for yourself that Gea & Casa Donatello are the BEST for a ROMAN HOLIDAY you will remember & LOVE forever!!"
12398,252103,2011-05-05,346621,Pablo,"Excellent!!! Apartment, host, everything perfect!  

Thank you so much!"
12398,267613,2011-05-17,469620,Andreas,"Gea's Rome flat was in a great location in a residential area near the olympic stadium. The flat was clean and comfortable. Gea was a delightful host, offering travel and resource advice to me verbally and via materials she collected. I would definitely stay here again!"
12398,332822,2011-06-25,463627,Jack,The apartment is all it is claimed to be.  The location is a residential neighborhood a short tram ride to Piazza del Popolo.  We enjoyed our stay and would be happy to do it again. Gea is a great hostess.
12398,618957,2011-10-11,4128,PÃ¤r,"We truly enjoyed staying at Geas (Email hidden by Airbnb) fy, stylish, extra-ordinarily well-equipped â and what a location! The #910 bus from the train station stops right outside the building and one block away is the #2 tram line, which takes you to Piazza del Popolo in five minutes, where there is both a busy bus terminal and a metro station, reaching more or less where ever you want to go. That is, if you (like us) prefer staying just a little outside the most touristy areas but still close enough to get there in an instant. Also, within a block or two you can find everything you need: at least three good restaurants (ask especially for Mamma Mia!), bakery, butcher shop, flower kiosk, wine store, beer store (!), fruit store, two dry-cleaners, pharmacy, and one of the most completely stocked organic grocery store we have ever visited short of Whole Foods! Amazing.

The bathroom and the lunch-counter style kitchen were clean and nice, and were both equipped with more stuff to use than we have at home. The bedroom is reasonably quiet, although you can hear the garbage collectors if you sleep with an open window. Comfortable beds (although with a quite hard mattress â a matter of preference), hardwood sliding-doors wardrobes, marble bathroom tilings, fast WiFi and lots of TV-channels, just as promised.

Add to this that we were very generously greeted by our hostess when we arrived, and that she took the trouble of seeing us off when we left. In short, what else could one ask for?

We recommend Geas place without reservations!"
12398,687295,2011-11-02,1261747,Shawna,"Gea was a magnificent host and her apt was everything and more. With only 5 minutes to the attractions, we also enjoyed her neighborhood and had the best dinner at a swanky Italian restaurant right around the corner. The food was ultimately the ""best"" and wasn't so pricey. I would suggest her apt to anyone as it was a home away from home. Thanks Gea"
12398,836920,2012-01-04,1307815,Eleanore,"A quick note of thanks to Gea for making her apartment available to us during our stay in Rome.  Casa Donatello  is located in a delightful neighborhood with convenient access to public transportation.  Geaâs apartment is beautifully appointed, warm and inviting.  We felt very much at home and enjoyed utilizing Geaâs lovely kitchen.  The apartment has all the necessary comforts; all you have to do is open the door and make yourself at home.

In addition to easy access to all the sights of Rome, life on Via Donatello affords you the opportunity to live like a Roman. You can shop in the local markets, pick up flowers at the local kiosk and even look for fashionable Italian clothing in the neighborhood boutiques.  We enjoyed our morning cappuccino and pastry at the neighborhood cafÃ©.

Gea is a remarkable hostess with a remarkable apartment located in a charming neighborhood.  Gea greeted us upon arrival to her apartment which was an added touch of warmth and hospitality. If you plan to visit Rome, you must stay on Via Donatello; you will experience Rome in a most sophisticated fashion.  

Thank you Gea for making our visit unique and making our New Years celebration special!  We will see you soon!

 Hugs! Eleanore & Joe

12398,1130791,2012-04-15,937756,Andree,"I enjoyed staying at Gea's at via Donatello.Gea was a thoughful host. Casa Donatello was in a very nice neighborood with a tram taking us to Plaza del Popolo in the center of Rome.
the apartment was warm and inviting ,the kitchen had everything you need to prepare a meal .Everything was clean .
we will be happy to come back"
12398,1399260,2012-06-02,2106634,Roger,"I stayed at Casa Donatello for a month. The flat is located in a nice quiet neighborhood, close to the tram, which comes every few minutes to go into Piazza del Popolo (and the Flaminia metro station). The flat is nice, a good amount of space and has everything you need to live there for a month (or less).  Around the flat are a few cafes and restaurants as well, if you just want something close by.  Gea was a great host - she was away but arranged for a key pickup from the doorman. All questions through email were promptly answered and she left the flat clean, tidy and welcoming. If you need a flat in Rome, this is a good choice."
12398,2511929,2012-10-05,2286072,Raymond,"Casa Donatello was delightful and perfect for our Rome vacation.  We were only 2 people, but 4 people could have easily stayed here.  This clean, pretty, comfortable home had everything:  large sunny rooms with attractive cabinets in each room, comfortable bed, modern kitchen appliances and bathroom facilities including large shower and bidet, comfortable living room furniture with beautiful marble floors, and pretty entryway from the street.  Its location was so convenient for tourists, comfortable walking distance from Piazza del Popolo, the tram to the Metro, wonderful farmer's market, numerous other shops and markets, in an attractive, safe, and lively neighborhood with friendly people on the streets (in case you need to ask directions!).  Gea was a wonderful, charming, courteous, knowledgeable, and very thorough host.  Before arriving, we had communicated with her several times with all our questions which she was so nice to answer.  Also, our shuttle was late coming from the airport and she waited for us.  We appreciated most of all that she explained everything about her house very well and she provided so many extra items for our comfort and convenience (everything from tools, spices, first aid supplies, soap, and paper towels to sewing tools).  We didn't need to use everything, but we saw that they were there in case they were needed.  The Wifi capability was convenient and reliable for our iPad and she allowed us to use the phone for local calls if necessary.  She even left wall maps, hand maps, Rome information books, and a globe for references.  We strongly recommend Gea's Casa Donatello and would definitely stay there again if we have another opportunity to come to Rome.  It was an excellent home away from home.  "
12398,2594869,2012-10-13,2484610,Colin,"We had a wonderful 7 days at  Gea's apartment in Rome. This was our first airbnb booking experience and we will use airbnb from now on. We found the site's filter ability very useful and it allowed us to narrow down our choices based on our specific wants, such as washer, wi fi, and non-smoking  apartment.
 
Before and after confirming the booking, Gea kept in touch with us to make sure we had all the information we required. 

The apartment was exactly as described,  and as shown in the pictures. We chose it based on the positive reviews which we also can now concur with .

Gea met us at the door on arrival and gave us an overview of where things were and how things worked. After that she left us to enjoy her apartment and we were able to keep in touch via (Hidden by Airbnb) .

The positives for us were the extra bedroom, which had lots of shelf space to spread out our belongings for the week.  The main bedroom was very large, the living area comfortable and the eat in kitchen was great, and included the washer, and new dishwasher., and toaster. 

The bathroom was wonderful, with full size sink and the largest shower we have experienced in Europe.  

Gea had fully stocked the kitchen with essentials like coffee, sugar, paper towels and all the utensils and pots available for cooking. Dish-washing and laundry soap was in the cupboard. There were  tissue  boxes in the bedrooms and bathroom something we did not see in the three hotels we had just stayed at before we arrived at Gea's apt. 

A supermarket is just steps away and we bought food and bread for breakfasts, packed lunches,and cooked a couple of suppers too. 

The apartment is bright in all rooms, the windows opened for air, and were double glazed to keep the street sounds out.  Having a building concierge at the main door made us comfortable. 

It was very conveniently located, a short walk to a street car line and then a 5 minute ride direct to the Piazza de Popolo from where you could either take the Metro, or just walk into the centre of Rome and the main shopping streets.

Since we were there for 7 days we bought a transit pass for 24 Euro each . and got great use, hopping on and off buses especially when we got lost. 

Overall, a perfect visit and we thank Gea for her hospitality and hope you will get to experience it too.

"
12398,2731843,2012-10-27,3845623,Andy,"We stayed in Rome for a week in October 2012 at Gea's apartment and it could not have gone any better. Gea is an extremely kind and genuine girl and gave us great advice on our arrival; it was a real pleasure to meet her. We were a little late getting to the apartment but she was there to greet us with a smile, and she gave us plenty of ways to reach her if we had any questions or problems during our stay (we didn't). We had no trouble finding her apartment with her directions and the apartment is located in a wonderful area in Rome.

There is a tram less than a five minute walk from the front door that takes you right to the metro - getting to all the major attractions is quick and easy. You can also use a bus on the corner to get right to the main metro station. Very convenient. Her apartment was impeccably clean and her neighbors were friendly. If I ever make my way back to Rome i will certainly be staying with Gea again.

We really appreciate your hospitality, Gea. Highly recommended. "
12398,3290059,2013-01-06,4306624,Mary,"Four of us stayed 5 nights at Gea's apartment and we were extremely pleased with the experience. The space was lovely, and  Gea  had equipped it extremely thoughtfully, even leaving some food staples for us to use. Everything was very clean, the two double beds were comfortable and warm, all the relevant machines worked as they should, and Gea herself was extremely helpful and friendly. The only tiny fly in the ointment was the noise from street-cleaning machines at all hours, but there is nothing to be done about that. Public transportation to the center of the city is close by, and there are a couple of good food markets very close as well. If we come to Rome again we will definitely try to stay here again."
12398,4700085,2013-05-21,4925829,Chris,"This apartment was perfect for us because we were coming to watch the ATP tennis tournament at the Foro Italico, which is only a ten minute walk away. We liked being in a quieter zone, (not withstanding the rubbish collections) and loved having a supermarket, vegetable shop and delicatessen in the next street, as well as a good restaurant. We ate in several times and I hugely appreciated the fact that Gea leaves the kitchen really well stocked with olive oil, vinegar, condiments, tea, coffee etc. In fact there were many thoughtful touches, videos and CD's, an Italian dictionary, maps etc, not to mention the Internet. The place is well furnished and comfortable, a real home from home. Thank you Gea, "
12398,4963180,2013-06-04,4120585,Sabine,"Awesome, clean, well situated apartment. We stayed there with our 9 month old baby and it went very well. Major bonus is that Gea stocks her apartment really well! Coffee, sugar, soaps, toilet paper, paper towel, etc. etc.! 
We walked to Piazza del Popolo almost every day - takes about 20 minutes, and for food and groceries, there is absolutely everything you need within 5 or less minutes. 
The apartment stays cool through the night, though we could hear our neighbour and his TV so bring earplugs if you're sensitive to noise. The bathroom has a huge shower but if you like to take long showers, you're out of luck because the hot water runs out in about 8 minutes or less. Not a problem for me but definitely made giving my baby a bath a little tougher.
All the appliances work really well and Gea even supplied extra sheets, towels etc.! 
I would recommend this apartment to everyone, including families with kids!
"
12398,5341760,2013-06-25,2483653,Marcy,"Gea's place was the perfect stay! The location was wonderful, just far enough from tourists but close enough to get to all the main attractions. Gea was a true pleasure, friendly and receptive to all our questions; it was a bonus that she met us at the apartment when we first arrived and helped to make the start of our trip that much better. Her place was very clean, comfortable and spacious in a very nice and safe neighborhood. We would definitely love to stay there again. "
12398,5575186,2013-07-07,3924651,Emmanuel,"Gea is a wonderful host, she promptly replied to our emails with questions we had prior our travelling and was waiting for us at the apartment when we arrived. 

 Her apartment is very clean, in a quiet neighbourhood with easy access to local transport links eg the bus into Termini or the tram to Flaminia leading to popular tourist sites eg Piazza del Popolo, The Spanish steps and Fontana di Trevi. It is also conveniently surrounded by good restaurants and a supermarket. 

I would highly recommend staying at her apartment for anyone thinking about traveling to Rome."

12398,7857997,2013-10-06,8920182,Harrison,"Lovely stay at Gea's place. The flat is a nice and relaxed home away from home with all the amenities you need. Its in a nice, leafy neighbourhood near the river. The tram is incredibly easy to take to the beginning of the old town and takes on 5 minutes. Gea helped us out with Taxis as well, which was greatly appreciated. Very recommended. "
12398,8136189,2013-10-17,2584459,Melissa,"Our family of four (kids aged 10 and 7) had a lovely stay at Gea's apartment, and really enjoyed our 5 nights in Rome.  The apartment is very clean and well equipped, and the images shown are accurate. Gea is really very helpful, and while we didn't meet her, she answered any questions very quickly, which was appreciated.

Via Donatella is in a lovely area, with great restaurants locally, so after a day of walking around in the historic part of the city we were more than happy to try out the local restaurants.  We loved the tree bar in the gardens across from the tram stop near the house - ideal as kids can play in the park while parents enjoy a cocktail or two.  Our tip is definitely go with the public transport option for getting to and from Ciampino airport.  Although taxis clearly display 30 euros from the airport to the centre of Rome, via Flaminia area does not count as part of the historic city zone, so you will pay 55 - 60 euros."
12398,8269593,2013-10-22,5549215,Silvana,"The apartment is great, clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. My husband and I had a great stay in Rome. The apartment is perfect, is located in a quiet area near the apartment there are cafes, restaurants and supermarkets. When we arrived to the apartment everything was perfect. Gea is very concerned and attentive. excellent host."
12398,8329783,2013-10-26,8365502,Diane,"This was the first trip to Rome for my sister and I.   It was an amazing experience.  The apartment was fabulous.  Spacious, clean, well equipped, and in a a great location.  Having two separate bedrooms, reliable wireless, and a large bathroom was definitely a plus.  One of my favorite things to do each morning was to open the large windows, take in the fresh air and people watch.  Everything we wanted to do was within walking distance.  We found a nice and inexpensive grocery store just a few minutes away as well as great eating establishments.  The tram and metro was close by for our day trips, although we found out that we could comfortably walk to the Trevi fountain, Spanish steps, and Pantheon.   Gia was a great host and I loved using airbnb!!"
12398,8599584,2013-11-07,4589637,Barbara,"This is a lovely flat. Excellent wifi (not always the case in italy!!) and pleasant neighbourhood. Comfortable bed and lots of closet space. very clean. I really enjoyed staying there and would recommend it!
"
12398,11261505,2014-03-27,9345333,Peter,"This is a great apartment in an excellent neighbourhood. I stayed in Gea's wonderfuld apartment for 16 days and it was the perfect choice for me. The apartment is large, bright, ultraclean and very well equipped. The shower in the bathroom is worth a special mention - it is really spacious. I ran the Rome Marathon during my stay and the thought of that shower kept me going during the last couple of kilometres. The neighbourhood around via Donatello and Viale Vignola is brilliant. It has a very authentic local Roman atmosphere and is still not very far from the city centre (a brisk 15-minute walk to Piazza del Popolo or you can take the tram). The area has several good restaurants, e.g. Osteria Sireno and Pizzeria Vignola, and plenty of local shops, including a well-stocked organic supermarket and a good small Enoteca right across from the apartment.
Gea is a great hostess, she is very kind and informative, and our communication during the booking process and my arrival/departure was faultless. I will certainly choose Gea's apartment for my next stay in Rome. In fact, I cannot wait to return to Rome and Casa Donatello. Highly recommended!  "
12398,11640685,2014-04-10,9243297,Charan,"Imagine if you had a friend in Rome with a large, beautiful, and fully stocked apartment in Rome, and they asked you to house-sit. That was what it felt like to stay in Casa Donatello. The apartment is huge, sunny, clean, and everything worked well. What is more, is unlike the typical minimalist, Ikea-decorated AirBnB rental, this apartment was stylishly decorated and well set up. The kitchen was set up with olive oil, balsamico, salt, sugar, coffee, etc. and we loved cooking there with Italian ingredients while listening to the great CDs in her collection (John Coltrane, Iggy Pop, etc.). 

The location is not central, and it costed us about 55 Euros for a taxi from the airport, but we appreciated the fact that the neighborhood was quiet and safe. It is also not far from some tourist spots (Spanish steps, Piazza del Popolo), but in general you will want to take the tram in, so that you can really explore the city. 

Anyway, Gea's apartment really made our Rome vacation special. Strongly recommended!"
12398,11831189,2014-04-16,12399336,Jayne,"Excellent apartment, spacious, wonderful host, it had everything we needed.  the apartment is spotlessly clean and secure.  Although not in the direct tourist area it is in a lovely neighborhood and I think that this made our stay better and more authentic than if we were in the busy part.  It is a quick 5 to 10 minute train (the train is on a loop so you only ever wait a couple of minutes for the next one) to the centre of town.  

We really loved this place and would stay again."
12398,12080385,2014-04-22,385336,Daniel,"This is a lovely flat.
Very clean;  and pleasant neighborhood; walking distance from  ultra-modern, marvelous Zaha Hadid's museum: MAXXI and Renzo Piano's - Auditorium Parco della Musica.
Comfortable bed in quiet bedroom.
I really enjoyed staying there and would recommend it!
Gea is very friendly and helpful person."
12398,12663114,2014-05-07,13409056,Erick,"I spent just over a week in Gea's apartment near the Flaminia and found everything to be perfect.  The apartment was exactly as described, clean, with everything working properly.

The location is very convenient given close access to the #2 tram line, a supermarket, and an organic food store on the next block.

The apartment has a ""cozy"" feel given the art, books, and other decorative items, in contrast to a sterile hotel room.

All-in-all, I would book another stay in Gea's apartment without hesitation!"
12398,12893340,2014-05-13,12881168,Rochelle,"Gea was very friendly and helpful. She was out of town when we arrived and her friend met us there who didn't speak english but she told us this beforehand. My husband and I stayed there with my parents. The apartment is very homey. It is beautifully decorated, lots of books and everything you could need. The shower was great but unfortunately there didn't seem to be enough hot water for all four of us :( The neighbourhood was lovely and we enjoyed the local restaurant and their stuffed potatoes. We arrived at the central train station around 5pm and it took us about an hour on the bus to get to the apartment with the traffic. We didn't try figuring out the metro so took the taxi a bit and it wasn't too expensive. It was around a 30min walk to get to the main attractions, it is a little further out so we usually left the apartment for the day instead of coming back for a rest and going out again because it was too much time going back for a rest. But this is only because we were in Rome for too short a time and trying to fit a lot in! I would definitely stay at Gea's again and relax more in Rome because it was nice to be out of the tourist areas."
12398,13135185,2014-05-20,4925829,Chris,"Have you ever been to a rented property and been annoyed at the total lack of provisions? No, salt, pepper....washing up liquid? Well if you stay at Casa Donatello you will have the complete opposite experience. Gea is incredibly generous, she leaves you absolutely everything you need for your stay, condiments, tea, coffee, spices, pasta, washing powder, she even left toothpaste and soap. It became a game to find something missing and we lost! Even sandwich bags were there! Add to that the lovely, homely apartment in a perfect quiet location with great shops and restaurants nearby, why would you ever want to stay anywhere else? Thank you Gea!"
12398,14712120,2014-06-24,3823784,Daniel,"Me and my mum had a lovely time staying at Gea's place.  The arrangements were very well made for our arrival and Gea was responsive throughout, including with extra bits of advice regarding transport etc.  The apartment itself is great, with all the necessary amenities plus more.  It's also in a very nice location, with some nice shops and restaurants nearby, and close to public transport for accessing the main tourist sites. "
12398,32460502,2015-05-18,4925829,Chris,If you read my previous reviews you will see how much I like Casa Donatello. The fact that I have stayed there three times speaks volumes. This time I found the flat even more comfortable and I found more thoughtful touches from Gea. She even leaves a new toothpaste out. Wonderful. The extra bonus this year is that we finally managed to meet. Lovely lady Gea. 
12398,38951855,2015-07-19,14578458,Francis,The home is centrally located and ideally situated for exploring Rome. Kitchen is well stocked and all is in good working order. The host is generous. For hot weather the Bedrooms could use fans as the AC is in only one of the three rooms.

14181,52718,2010-06-13,134716,Galen,"Ivan was a friendly and very gracious host to my boyfriend and I while we were visiting Rome for three days. His apartment is located near a Metro stop and very close to the Vatican, which was a big plus for our site seeing, though it isn't located near any real bars/clubs so we didn't see much of the nightlife. The apartment itself was clean, and the bed comfortable. And he's got WiFi and a laundry machine. The one drawback to be aware of is that Ivan smokes, so if you're very sensitive to that you shouldn't stay here. That said, the only time you could tell he's a smoker was when he was actually smoking; the rest of the time the smell didn't linger. Overall, thumbs up and thanks, Ivan. "
14181,57574,2010-06-26,148236,Tyson,Fantastic apartment. Huge bedroom and a really nice clean bathroom. Great location within walking distance to the Vatican and a metro. Ivan was a great host and made our stay Rome so comfortable that we will definately be returning.
14181,280572,2011-05-25,502834,Ludwik,"We spent three unforgettable days in Rome in an apartment of Ivan, who is open, helpful and very friendly person. The location is very convenient, walking distance to the Vatican, and to the center 15 min by subway or 25 or 30 minutes by bus. Very nice neighborhood with nice local cheap bars and cheap supermarket. For us it was important :  we could cook for ourselves, using the fully equipped kitchen. Room rates - excellent. Next time definately would like to come back this place :) Thank you Ivan :)"
14181,301921,2011-06-07,192519,Nadine,We loved our stay with Ivan! He is very nice and helped us out a lot with organising the sightseeing and other things. Ivan is a great host and we loved his flat. The bed was very comfortable and I loved his little reading room with the books. His flat is in the 4 floor and I thought that was a nice free workout to get up there!!!! We would always stay with him again.. Ivan did you get our little good bye letter???All the best and good luck. Nadine and Kathrin....
14181,332892,2011-06-25,498719,Michael Jae,"My stay in Rome could not have been any more comfortable. I was situated in Ivan's apartment for 12 days. It was minutes to the metro, Ottaviano station, and just 2 more to the Vatican City. Everywhere I wanted to go to was reachable either by walking or by the metro. It was in a nice neighborhood where you didn't have the chaos of tourist running around at all hours, and made the experience very authentic true to Rome. The apartment was very large, and well furnished with all the amenities that you need close at hand. The apartment was very clean, spacious with enough privacy for when it was needed. Ivan was a fantastic host. He provided everything I needed and made the stay very welcoming, enjoyable and friendly. I would highly recommend staying at Ivan's if you want comfort, accessibility and the full Roman experience at a very inexpensive cost. This is definitely I place I would and will stay again at in the near future."
14181,534428,2011-09-15,1093835,Juliette,"Our stay in Ivan's appartement was nice and comfortable. The room was big and everything was clean. Ivan was friendly and discreet. He has great taste ! There was everything you can need, specially in the kitchen.  The neighborhood is quiet and nice. Plus we almost done everything by walking, about 30 minutes from the center. And you always pass in front of St Peter's Basilica by night or day, its nice. Great experience, definitely recommended. "
14181,551122,2011-09-20,238986,Marianne,"Ivan's apartment is lovely! It is about a 10-15 min walk from the Vatican and the Vatican's metro stop (although you can get a bus faster too). The neighbourhood has some good restaurants just around the corner. The room itself is much bigger than we expected, with a sofa to hang out on too. We left the window open most nights and still slept very well - it was lovely pushing back the shutters in the morning and seeing a local Roman view! Ivan's apartment feels open and creative: the soundproofing is great, the wifi is reliable and I would consider staying again."
14181,611031,2011-10-09,984927,Janelle,"Ivan was a fantastic host, who gave us great recommendations on sights, food etc.  The apartment is in a great location, very close to Vatican City, but far enough away that you feel you are in 'real Italy'.  Ivan obviously has very great taste when it comes to decorating a home, and we hope to stay there again when we return to Roma! "
14181,645927,2011-10-19,1245200,Santa,"Ivan was a great host and he's extremely good at room decoration. He was really friendly and kind, although we didn't get to talk with him that much because we left apartment early and got back late. But the time spent there was really pleasant because the apartment was so colorful and interesting that one couldn't feel bored there. And it was so clean in there and the ambience was light and pleasantly easy. Thanks for everything Ivan!"
14181,2302503,2012-09-17,944585,Alexey,"The apartment is very nice, big and cozy. It's very close to bus stop and you can also get to metro station and Vatican by foot. By the way there are some nice places to go near (bars and restaurants) And Ivan is a cool host. He gave us delicious homemade chocolate :)
So I reccomend this room to everyone. Thank you!"

Design of the apartment and fact that Ivan works in cinematography attracted us very much. We are cinema people too. The apartment turned out even more charming than we thought. Apartment has convenient location, original and individual design. Ivan is very delicate and well-mannered person. It was very pleasant to see a large number of books in his house, including books about art of cinema. Ivan taught us to cook pasta. Weâll cook this traditional Italian food and warmly will remember the few days in Rome which became closer thanks to Ivan."
14181,2457293,2012-09-30,3458018,Lubomir,Ivan was nice host and we really enjoyed the feeling of privacy in his apartment. At same time he was always there when we needed some help from him. He was not preparing special breakfast but allowed us to use what was available in the fridge and the kitchen.
14181,2793183,2012-11-03,3790560,Nathalie,"Our stay was smooth. 
The apartment has a great location (nice building) : near The Vatican,  
buses, Ottaviano metro station and easy walk to all main sites. 
The place was clean, very quiet, and has pleasant atmosphere. The room is very large. We used the kitchen for breakfast and also for diner.
Yvan was so friendly and speaks very good English so it was very easy to communicate with him.
We will definitely stay here again and will recommend it to friends
Thanks for all, Ivan
"
14181,3547360,2013-02-15,1282355,Achim,We very much enjoyed our stay at Ivans place. He is a really nice and polite person. Like us Ivan is working in film production and gave us some insight on the Italian film business. The room is nice and clean and the bed is comfortable. We used the well equipped kitchen for breakfast and to cook dinner. The flat is packed with all kinds of illustrated art books so on a rainy day there are enough sights to look at without even leaving the house. Ivan recommended some very nice restaurants in the neighborhood and even gave us his unneeded coffee maker as a present. This place is definitely recommended! Thanks again Ivan! 
14181,4035602,2013-04-04,5373972,Ana,"Ivan is a great host, and the apartment is really nice, roomy and close to the Vatican, metro and buses. Thanks for everything :)))"

Ivan est de plus un hÃ´te charmant, oiseau de nuit discret mais prÃ©venant. Avons passÃ© une soirÃ©e improvisÃ©e ensemble trÃ¨s sympa. Merci Ivan !! "
14181,5084013,2013-06-11,6241991,Wiemer," A wonderful stay at Ivan's apartment - roomy, and in a building with a nice patina of age, in the 19 - beginning 20 century Prati quarter.
This part of the quarter has many small shops, restaurants, and a very nice food market [Trionfale],  and is not flooded with tourists.
Our host Ivan is a modest, very friendly man, who lets you do your own thing, but is also helpful and ready to advise. An interested man one can speak with over all sort of things.
Thank you Ivan!
"
14181,5655849,2013-07-10,5395207,Peter,"Ivan was very helpful prior to us arriving, he printed out some vatican and coliseum tickets. He was a lovely host- while he was busy working he offered great advice. Thanks Ivan!"
14181,7380992,2013-09-17,6070772,Helen,"Ivan was a very sympatico host and very kind when I had to curtail my stay as my father was ill. The room is large and airy and not far from the stylish Prati area and within easy walking distance to the Vatican. I'll definitely rent from him again. 
"
14181,21759702,2014-10-23,3055761,Hans,"Great place to stay in a nice, quiet area of prati. Metro is (just about) in walking distance and prati is pretty, elegant and much more relaxed than the centro storico. Ivan wasn't there while we were so we couldn't profit from his cooking skills but from the equipment in his kitchen i'm sure he's a great chef! Thanks ivan"
14181,29461224,2015-04-07,9742803,Katja,"It has been a pleasure to be Ivans guests. The apartment is located really close to the center, however the neighbourhood itself has already a good amount of shops, restaurants and bars. Even if we had a bad flight delay and arrived in the middle of the night, Ivan was kindly waiting for us and made us feel welcome. The apartment and our room was quiet, clean, very nice decorated and furnished and made us feel like being at home. We fully enjoyed our stay in Rome and in Ivans home and would definitely come back!"
14181,29987964,2015-04-15,29880183,Christophe,TrÃ¨s bon accueil de la part d'Ivan. Lâappartement est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et d'un calme absolu. L'emplacement Ã  500m du mÃ©tro rajoute un peu de marche en fin de journÃ©e: mais de toute faÃ§on Ã  Rome on marche beaucoup... Je le conseille sans hÃ©sitation.
14181,37249553,2015-07-05,3203238,Ido,"Ivan is a realy great person!  
His apartment is unique and very spacious, furnished by all of the necessities. The neighborhood Prati has all of the facilities to offer, Not over crowded and safe. 

Had a really good time in three!"

14181,135265396,2017-03-04,2197746,Thomas,Beautiful apartment and very hospitable host! About 10 minute walk to the closest metro station. Location is nice in a very local area. Not many tourists in the area.

16276,73703,2010-08-04,111078,Taberah Joy,Good price for location.  It is loud.  And she was not very flexible about check out times.  It left me and my sister to haul our luggage about Rome on our last day.  But still a good deal considering the alternatives.  
16276,104496,2010-09-25,186144,Monica,"Nariya and Andrea were very sweet hosts.  They advised us on where to eat, gave us a clear map of the city, a tip on a great view of the city and were willing to be available and helpful in anyway they could.  We ended up being upgraded to an apartment, which was a nice surprise, and ended up being in a bit quieter area (although just a few blocks away) then where the bnb location. 

Breakfast was sufficient, a packaged croissant, cereal, juice and a espresso machine (which we had a bit of difficulty figuring out). We ended up going to a nearby bar for our breakfast coffee and pastry, mainly for the experience! 

Trastevere is a wonderful area filled with nice people, a vibrant social life and is truly where a lot of people live.  There are less tourists here, yet still plenty of people who speak English.  We would highly recommend staying in this area, as everything is close enough to walk to, but far enough that you're not stuck in the center of the busiest part of the city.  "
16276,261575,2011-05-13,388641,Sally,"We stayed in a wonderful, very quiet, second location, just around the corner from Calisto 6 and so close to Piazza di Santa Maria.  Andrea made sure someone was there to meet us and the accommodations were great, with plenty of space, simple but tasty breakfast, coffee, a comfy bed and we loved Trastevere!  I highly recommend it!  "
16276,1606277,2012-07-01,2146175,Leeann,"Good location, rooms were clean, this bed & breakfast is run very much like a business.  A few issues with air conditioning and plumbing (hosts were receptive in trying to solve).  "
16276,17210649,2014-08-09,16810179,John,"A great location in Rome, with great nightlife in the square and the square adjacent and some wonderful and well priced restaurants as well. 

Beautiful bedroom and well priced. Would certainly recommend. "
16276,35434895,2015-06-18,14983947,Cathy,  The neighborhood was really cool - above a cafe and a beautiful plaza.  The host was great - offering assistance with a car to the airport and accommodating our changing arrival time.
17604,15157609,2014-07-03,16837608,Rachel,"Barbara and Marco were gracious hosts. They offered to pick us up at the train station. As we had heavy luggage, we decided to take a taxi instead.
Marco met us at the apartment and showed us everything. We needed to do laundry and there was no fabric softener so he ran to the store and picked us up some.  He sat down with us and explained where everything was, also provided maps of the area. 
Positives: location, although it's not in the ""pretty part of Ostia"" it's right around the corner from it. Super close to the beach and around the corner from the centre and the nightly ""passeggio"" where people walk by the sea at night. The apartment is very spacious and comfortable.
Opportunities for improvement: they could use a new mattress in the master bedroom, as the one that is there is quite old and not very comfortable. Extra pillows would come in handy as well, we grabbed the ones from the smaller bedroom with 2 single beds though as we were only occupying one room. Also they use a portable wi-fi modem that does not get the best signal and only comes with 3gb, so if you need to use internet to (Hidden by Airbnb) with family back home, or book upcoming travel, make sure to do as much as you can before arriving there as it is mostly for email usage."
17604,15685879,2014-07-14,15402348,Olga,Everything was OK. Marco picked us up from the airport as we agreed (Thank you Marco). But the second appartment we lived in Ostia was better for less money.
17604,445983324,2019-04-30,104070333,Julien,"It was a nice week past in this appartment, also the welcome was nice.
It is near of the beach, and there is lot of nice shops arround. It was without wifi, but I had it on my phone so it was ok.
Thank you for this time in your appartment Barbara :)."
20534,82076,2010-08-21,171962,Marie-Eve,"We where very pleased to find this great studio in such popular area of Rome. It was fully furnished, clean and the terrasse on the roof top was pleasant. Sabrina, is a great host and provided us with good info on the area. We recommand this place and the price worth it."
20534,449663,2011-08-16,34526,Andre,"Great little cozy place in a fun neighborhood - Trastevere.  Check in was easy.  Apartment was clean and looked like the pictures.  One issue - we were there in August and had a problem with mosquitoes (no screens on the windows), also the A/C was pretty loud.  Other than that, it was a great. Would recommend."
20534,1078904,2012-04-03,1155380,Kate,great location near bars and cafes. the rooms are nice and the terrace is lovely! I would definitely stay here again. I have been telling all of my friends what a great place we found in Rome

Elle prend le temps de tout expliquer, de vous conseiller. C'est certain que si je retourne Ã  Rome, je m'arrangerai pour avoir un appartement dont Sabrina s'occupe.

P.S. Sabrina nous avait recommandÃ© un restaurant Romain sur la rue Via Del Cedro, tout simplement dÃ©licieux. Aucun menu, nous prenons ce que le patron nous mets sur la table. De la vraie cuisine Romaine qui Ã©tait excellente. Merci Sabrina pour nous avoir suggÃ©rÃ© ce restaurant.
"
20534,2055054,2012-08-21,2373862,Stacy,"Great apartment in an awesome location, really quite and very close walking distance to lots of restaurants and shopping!!!  Very convenient. Rooftop terrace was lovely for pre evening drinks and sunbathing! Only downside was the air conditioner was so so noisy, we were there in august so it was hot! So noisy air conditioner made it veery hard to sleep - even with ear plugs.  Everything else was fabulous and Sabrina was very helpful and available whenever we needed to call her. Great stay in Roma."
20534,2724868,2012-10-26,1031868,Kenny,"Sabrina's flat was a perfect sanctuary for any traveler after a long day of sightseeing and walking the city.  It is located in the busy neighborhood of Trastevere but is situated on a quiet street so you are not disturbed by the hustle bustle of nightlife.  I would recommend this space for couples or solo travelers.  The terrace was great for pre-dinner cocktails and enjoying the great views.  The apt was very clean and Sabrina was more than helpful recommending restaurants, sights and answering any questions I had about the city.  "
20534,2941686,2012-11-22,4006520,Amy,"We absolutely loved our stay in Trastevere in this apartment. It was exactly what we needed and in an outstanding location!! Sabrina was a fantastic host...met us when we got slightly lost upon arrival and gave us a lot of great tips. She was so friendly and helpful. The apartment completely met our needs. The shower was hot and good water pressure and the bed very comfortable. It was an old apartment, so had great charm with wooden ceiling beams. The best part of the apartment, apart from the location which really can't be beat, is the rooftop terrace. Awesome view and so lovely to have a glass of wine up there at the end of the day. The apartment is slightly below ground, so the the windows are up high and there is little light, but we were out during the day so not a big deal, and at night it had such a romantic, cozy feel. In the bedroom, the window is close to street level and when the window is open you could hear cars parking and people walking and talking through the night, but it didn't bother us at (Website hidden by Airbnb) fact, it all sounded like white noise at the end of the day. Maybe after living years in NYC I have become immune to outside noise. I would recommend this apartment to anyone and we'll definitely return. "
20534,5457267,2013-07-01,6420652,Rasmus,Sabrina was extremely helpful and what a great location. Many thanks Sabrina

20534,7826970,2013-10-05,7755906,Jen,"Really lovely apartment in a great area of Rome. Ideal location, perfect for wineing and dining with the locals after a busy day checking out all the tourist locations in the city. All the main spots are within walking distance (we did the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona and the Panthenon in one day) and you're only a half hour walk from the Vatican. (Tip: walk up the hill at the back of the apartment to get an amazing panormaic view of the entire city!!)

Trastevere is lively and bustling, but the apartment is just off the main stretch (literally one minute round the corner) so it was never noisy at night. Good sized place for two people sleeping in seperate rooms, as long of you don't mind sleeping in the lounge kitchen area which we found no problem at all.

Fantastic roof space, great for a quick drink in the evening before heading out to the local bars and restaurants.

We didn't require much help from our host Sabrina but she was always extremely quick to respond to emails and text queries, and on our departure she very kindly arranged for a taxi to collect us without any hassle at all.

Would definitely recommend this apartment to others."
20534,10450781,2014-02-19,1764471,Marina,"Choosing Sabrina's apartment was a truly wise decision). Ideally located in the heart of Trastevere, this place is fully equipped with all the necessary things - washing machine, tiny kitchenette, perfect heating system, etc. The place is perfectly clean and very cozy. The beautiful rooftop terrace is beyond any imagination.Sabrina is a wonderful, absolutely charming  host, always ready to help you. We wouldn't think twice about a place to stay the next time we come to Rome.
Sabrina, grazie tantissimo!"

Anytime again! Thanks for the nice days!"
20534,12971944,2014-05-16,12924674,Don,My wife and I spent 4 nights at Cedro 1.  Apartment was as advertised and was perfect for us. Rooftop terrace was a bonus.  And the location in the heart of Trastevere cannot be beat. We never met Sabrina but her assistant was there to greet us and give as great advice.  Sabrina also did a great job of arranging a driver from the airport to the apartment.   
20534,13206598,2014-05-22,351825,Gary,"This was the second time we have stayed at Sabrina's apartments and it is the perfect location for walking to many key sites in Rome. 
Cedro 1 was very comfortable with everything we needed. As the ground floor room it was a little dark. The upstairs rooms are much lighter.overall it was great experience. The terrace is lovely.
Sabrina is close by telephone helped us with a taxi back to the airport."

The apartment has everything you need for a few days in Rome. Trastevere is the perfect neighborhood in Rome, across the street from all the tourist sites and yet authentic and local. The sandwich place downtairs called ""Pianostrada"" was perfect for lunch, food was fresh and the girls who run the place are absolutely charming! I  wish I could thank them again here. It was difficult finding a place for dinner because its always fully booked so I suggest reserving in advance. The only negative I can share is that the shower was very small and a bit uncomfortable. I kept knocking my elbows :) I will be returning to this apartment every time I'm in Rome. Thank you Sabrina. "
20534,14022643,2014-06-10,12440992,Rebekka,We realy enjoyed staying at Sabrina's. It is a lovely neighborhood en we have eaten in very cute restaurants. Sabrina's place is clean and perfect for a few days stay in Rome; the most wonderful place is the world!
20534,17103564,2014-08-07,15148414,Brendan,"We had a fantastic time in Rome, and really enjoyed staying at this apartment in Trastevere. The location was perfect, walking distance from all of the major tourist attractions: the Vatican, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, etc. 

The apartment itself was fine. The bed was comfortable, the kitchen had a nice refrigerator, plates and eating utensils, and the bathroom/shower was small but sufficient. The building has a nice rooftop terrace, which we used on hot afternoons for a glass of wine or to play cards, read and relax. "
20534,17926903,2014-08-19,6958335,Elena,"The apartment is well located. Though a bit noisy. Lots of restaurants around. Roof terrace is nice. Good apartment with beautiful furniture, but noisy air conditioning. But there were cockroaches in the apartment! We reported this to Sabrina. She offered to move to another apartment in the same building. While in the apartment there is a struggle with cockroaches. A few days later, we moved again to this apartment. This gave us uncomfortable (two moved in 9 days). However, the problem has not disappeared. This situation with cockroaches and move very spoiled the experience of the trip. Sabrina quickly responded to our requests.

20534,23724066,2014-12-08,21675863,Tore,A very good apartment for us (a couple) with perfect location in Trastevere. The host responded quickly and precise. We was met at the apartment exactly on time with a very kind and efficient welcome. I'll go back.

Check in was super easy.  The terrace is very pleasant.  The location in Travestere is absolutely perfect in the evenings, this is a great stop in Rome.  Thank you!"

Humide, sombre et petit.
Quartier trÃ¨s animÃ©, avec l'inconvÃ©nient d'un appartement bruyant.
NÃ©anmoins Sabrina a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s comprÃ©hensive et donc m'a gentillement proposÃ©e le remboursement des nuits Ã  venir rÃ©servÃ©es."

Especially when the bars close. If you're a light sleeper, or unaccustomed to city noise, bring earplugs. The rooftop patio is very nice and Paolo, who met us for check-in, was great."

This is the only spot in Trastevere to stay.

Paulo was a trove of knowledge and ideas. Great hosts!!

Stay here!"
20534,308405034,2018-08-16,84772474,Amaury,"Perfect place to stay around one week in Roma in a very festive neighborhood.
The flat is super clean and pleasant for 2 travellers, the roof-top is a beautiful place to enjoy the evening.
Sabrina and Paolo are very welcoming and patient: they are attentive to answer to all the questions I might have during my stay.
I recommend strongly this apartment!"
20534,340482544,2018-10-24,24676664,Guillermo,"Excelente ubicaciÃ³n en barrio con mucho movimiento, para caminar mucho. El automÃ³vil casi no puede utilizarse."
20534,342075695,2018-10-28,85890350,Adrien,"Merci Ã  Sabrina pour le sÃ©jour passÃ© dans son appartement.
L'appartement est situÃ© dans un quartier trÃ¨s actif en fin de journÃ©e. Ceci nous permettait de profiter de l'ambiance chaleureuse des aperitivi italien, de nous installer dans des restaurant typique, oÃ¹ encore flÃ¢ner dans les ruelles agrÃ©ables du Trastevere. 
La localisation de l'appartement nous a permis de faire quasiment tous nos dÃ©placements Ã  pieds. 
Les hÃ´tes sont disponibles, comprÃ©hensifs.
ExpÃ©rience Ã  renouveler volontiers pour un sÃ©jour peut Ãªtre un peu plus long."
20534,347928293,2018-11-12,40455549,Manon,"Logement conforme Ã  nos attentes. Parfaitement situÃ©, agrÃ©able et propre. 
Sabrina et Pablo sont trÃ¨s rÃ©actifs et arrangement."
20534,435041823,2019-04-09,1784625,Naomi,"This flat was clean and had all necessities required to enjoy your stay. Much appreciated having a baby bed provided and the extra bed made for my father in law who was visiting with us. Trastevere gets very loud at night on the weekends even a few side streets off. Being on the ground floor is a a bit loud. Also, it is required to lock the building door with a key when leaving which also makes it impossible to leave without a key... which seemed to be an unnerving fire hazard, especially having a child with us. Lastly, even though the hero image of this flat is of the terrace read the listing carefully- this terrace is SHARED  and this specific flat is on the ground floor, far away from it. Good communication with Paolo for checkin and checkout and they have a nice concept. We just would have preferred more transparency about the true layout of the building before booking."
20534,438723310,2019-04-17,13771943,Marie,Sabrinaâs home was perfect for our trip to Rome! Sabrina was quick to respond to any questions and very accommodating!! The location was perfect for our needs!! We highly recommend staying here!
20534,463893639,2019-06-04,19942624,Jamie,"Perfect location! We stayed here and absolutely loved being right in Trastevere. There's so many fantastic restaurans right around the corner that we spent most of our time in the area.
The apartment itself was pretty good for the three of us, and despite being on the ground floor it was pretty quiet. 
It does get a little damp and musty though, but not enough to bother us.
The rooftop terrace was great, and nice that it's shared if you want to talk to other guests etc.
The biggest down side for us was the communication on the day of arrival. Despite many messages we hadn't heard back to confirm check in details for keys and had to make our way to the apartment very unsure whether we'd get in. After an hour or so we luckily caught a couple guests on their way out who gave us the phone number for Paulo who saved the day. He was so lovely and helped us through the set up that it almost made up for the earlier issues."
20534,467463179,2019-06-10,1751642,Elif,Sabrina was very timely in responses. The apartment was very clean and very good located. Highly recommended !!
20534,474559822,2019-06-23,52095632,Raffaele,"A really nice little apartment in the heart of Trastevere, one of the most characteristic and fascinating districts of Rome. 
The hosts were really kind and replied promptly to any question or request.
The roof-top terrace is just amazing!"
20534,521854555,2019-09-01,32255860,Dritan,Nice place with a beautiful terrace Paolo was a very good host
20534,525981526,2019-09-08,288656871,Etienne,Appartement parfaitement situÃ© et agrÃ©able. Terrasse plus qu'apprÃ©ciable. Un peu bruyant la nuit le week-end mais c'est le pris de la situation au coeur de Trastevere.
20534,527658858,2019-09-11,287769672,Emily,"The location is ideal. The space is clean and well cared for. Thank you for the stay, we hope to visit again soon."

20587,112173,2010-10-05,216560,Ross,Sabrina was always available.  Great location...cozy apartment!  Thanks!
20587,256089,2011-05-09,274200,David,"Had a little mixup and spent the first night in the wrong apartment, but both apartments we saw were very nice.  The furnishings were very comfortable, and all the appliances and such were in excellent condition.  Sabrina was super-helpful and did what she could to make our stay enjoyable.

The location can't be beat- right in the heart of Trastevere, walking distance to most attractions in the historic center.

Didn't have time to take advantage of the rooftop patio as much as I would have liked, but the view of the surrounding rooftops of Trastevere was beautiful!

Definitely would stay here again next time I come to Rome."
20587,327863,2011-06-22,243423,Mary,"We had a wonderful stay in Cedro 4. Our host was a resource for all sorts of very useful information about Rome. She helped us to get tickets for events, guided us as we learned to use public transportation, and directed us to good shopping spots for our daily ventures in grocery shopping. The area was lively and fun. Each time we walked back to our apartment we passed through streets full of people enjoying summer evenings. I would not hesitate to book another stay at this location or with this host. "
20587,334678,2011-06-26,442540,Robin,"This is the most wonderful location in Rome!  My husband and I went with our two teenage daughters and t couldn't have been more perfect!  Two spacious bedrooms, a tiny sitting area that we never used and a miniscule but adequate bathroom.  It could get a bit noisy at night but the energy of the place is infectious and walking around at any hour is a joy.  Every corner holds a treasure and you can walk virtually anywhere in the city from there.  We didn't get to see Sabrina much because we were always out and about but she was lovely, warm, and welcoming when we did.  I would definitely stay there again next time I'm in gorgeous Roma!"
20587,996750,2012-03-13,1739359,Gijs & Brigitte,"Great location!!! Everything is clean and good, just not necessarily very personal interior. Really a vacation apt. super small shower!"
20587,1436678,2012-06-08,2100686,Eduardo,Clean and very conveniently located apartment. The only drawbacks are the extremely tiny bathroom and closet kitchen & the unrealiable Internet service. The hostess is absolutly wonderful.
20587,7550891,2013-09-24,7703122,Maria Julia,"Im Apartment Cedro 4 von Sabrina habe ich mich mit meinen drei erwachsenen Kindern sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt. Die Lage ist sehr gut, da wir alle SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten zu Fuss erreichen konnten. Das Haus liegt in einem romantischen, schmalen GÃ¤sschen, Lokale zum fein Essen liegen direkt in unmittelbarer NÃ¤he. Daher hÃ¶rt man abends etwas vom Gemurmel der GÃ¤ste, die draussen essen, was uns jedoch nicht gestÃ¶rt hat. Das schmucke Apartment ist sehr sauber und schÃ¶n eingerichtet. Die Terrasse zum FrÃ¼hstÃ¼cken war ein wunderbarer Ort fÃ¼r einen gelingenden Tagesbeginn. Wir kÃ¶nnen das Apartment sowie die aufgestellte Gastgeberin jedermann bestens empfehlen. Maria"
20587,32529118,2015-05-19,20495838,Lindy,"We had a very pleasant stay. Sabrina was very friendly, helpful and prompt to reply to our messages and any requests. We loved the roof terrace. The location in Trastevere was perfect. Lots of quaint restaurants, churches, museums and sights to visit. Only a 20 min walk to the centre of Rome and the Vatican. "
20587,33072702,2015-05-25,27737330,Agle,"What a great place to stay in Rome! Me and my three friends visited the city four days and this small apartment catered wonderfully to all of our needs. It was beautifully decorated and the roof terrace was very cosy. The apartment is in a great location too; so many great places to eat in Trastevere, just a short walk from the city centre and Vatican City.
We would definitely stay at this place again!"
20587,36949174,2015-07-03,30591659,Thomas,"God central beliggenhed tÃ¦t pÃ¥ restauranter og barer, og i gÃ¥afstand fra de fleste af Roms sevÃ¦rdigheder.

2 gode sovevÃ¦relser og en dejlig tagterrasse (fÃ¦lles med andre lejligheder)."
20587,37314111,2015-07-06,12214946,Dragan,"Terrace-Cedro 4 is perfectly located apartment in the hart of popular Trastevere district in Rome. Apartment is well maintained two-bedroom flat with small kitchenette. With the perfect location, it was easy to explore the city. Shower is a bit small  but serves its purpose perfectly. Communication with Sabrina was easy and effective. My family and I really appreciate all the help and understanding. We were allowed to leave our luggage in the apartment past check out time due to late flight. Also our hosts were resourceful and helped tremendously with our stay in Rome.    

Thank you!"
20587,40195948,2015-07-29,14225024,Roeli,"Super: toplocatie, hele goeie airco, klein maar fijne douche en een heerlijk bed."
20587,41577142,2015-08-08,26919449,Yves,"It was hot when we visited Rome (37Â°C during the day and not much less at night), so we were very pleased with the powerful and quiet air conditioning at Sabrina's apartment. Very good beds in the apartment; bathroom and kitchen were basic, but certainly sufficient (just don't expect to cook a 5-course meal for the whole family). Excellent wifi connection and a great terrace (though it was simply too hot to sit outside when we were there). All in all excellent value for money. The location was excellent in a very picturesque alley/neighborhood with dozens of (very reasonably priced) restaurants literally only a stone throw away. Piazza Navona  is a 10 minute walk, Vatican city a 20 minute walk; and if it is too hot to walk, there is a taxi stand at Piazza Trilussa, just a few hundred meters from the apartment (taxis are very reasonably priced if there are 3 or 4 of you - Piazza Trilussa to Termini was less than 10 â¬). Tip: if you are here in summer, go for a day to the beach at Santa Marinella, a 45 minute train ride from Trastevere station (4â¬ one way). Also good fun was a walk along the river at night (Lungo il Tevere summer festival). Another tip to cool down on hot summer days when travelling with teenagers: EURoma 2 shopping mall... (airconditioned and they have a Hollister and a Burger King...) And final tip: don't pay more than 5 â¬ for a selfie stick...!

20587,44276380,2015-08-25,2557913,Lauren,"Perfect location!! It's true what the other reviews say about the shower being small, however it serves it's purpose. We enjoyed our stay in Trastevere! We loved the terrace!"
20587,45779401,2015-09-06,19020352,Inge,The apartment was perfect for our holiday i Rome. Both the apartment and the large roof terrace lived certainly up to our expectations. The travestere area is perfect to stay in with short distance to almost everthing. We will definetely recommend the apartment and the area til others.  Our host Sabrina was helpfull with the transfer from and to the airport - thank you for that.
20587,68933099,2016-04-07,43861045,Gabrielle,"This was our first Airbnb experience and I must say it was really good. Trastevere in Roma is a vibrant area: always something going on. It has a real village feel to the place. Sabrina's place is down a little street, and whilst it may be away from the crowds, noise does travel, but we were able to cope with it. The apartment bedrooms are really nice and big. Wifi is great. Great terrace on the roof top. Kitchen is small - but functional. Shower is small however. 
Paolo met us when we arrived and was very helpful and around if we needed him. Sabrina is very lovely and between them both, they were very accommodating by organizing a car from Fumicino and allowing us to store our luggage overnight whilst we went up for Assisi for the night.  Thanks Sabrina and Paolo. "
20587,72016763,2016-04-30,26200088,Lisbeth,"Lejligheden er nÃ¸jagtig som beskrevet i tekst & billeder, ren & pÃ¦n og alt var i perfekt orden. Der var alt, hvad vi skulle bruge - ligefra proptrÃ¦kker til rene hÃ¥ndklÃ¦der og rent sengetÃ¸j. Alt var 100% i orden. 
Det var fantastisk at bo midt i hjertet  af den gamle bydel, Trastevere - med vasketÃ¸jet hÃ¦ngende over gaden, smÃ¥ restauranter og krogede brostens belagte gade i bedste ""Lady & Vagabond"" stil.
Vi havde 7 overnatninger og vi nÃ¸d hvert et minut. NÃ¦ste gang jeg skal til Rom vil jeg bo hos Sabrina igen.
Sabrina er fantastisk vÃ¦rt. Der er 100% styr pÃ¥ alt og Sabrina yder en super service og svarer altid hurtigt pÃ¥ en forespÃ¸rgsel. 
"
20587,77561733,2016-06-01,62062979,Lisa,"Lovely neighbourhood to stay in with good inexpensive restaurants and lively atmosphere. Easy walk to all the main sights and nice to retreat back to Trastavere for a break from the busier tourist areas.
Clean, we'll maintained flat with good sized bedrooms and very nice roof terrace. Very tiny shower but you're not going to spend much time there anyway.
Paolo met us when we arrived and was very helpful."
20587,80015174,2016-06-15,61838581,Dan,"Paolo greeted us for an early check-in, he was extremely friendly and accommodating! We loved our one-week stay in Trastevere and will never forget the experience!

Trastevere is central to many popular attractions. We walked from here to the Vatican as well as the Forum and Colosseum in under 30 minutes each. The area around the apartment is vibrant with many establishments and restaurants! We had no problem navigating  around the area to find wonderful places to shop and eat! Trastevere seems to be a haunt for the locals and really comes alive at night, especially in Summer, but fair warning for Summer visitors, the crowd can be noisy very late into the night.

There was only one issue we had with Vicolo Del Cedro 21, in unit 4 the shower was so small it was difficult to move or even raise your arms. Water gets everywhere on the floor, and it can be frustrating after too long. Other than that it was a very lovely stay and would recommend."
20587,83095588,2016-07-01,56472209,Sonia,"Sabrina was the perfect host answering all questions with a quick response. Paolo welcomed us at the apartment with keys and was helpful setting up transfer to and from airport.  The apt. was perfect for our family of four, centrally located in a very nice neighborhood with many cafes, bars and restaurants within walking to everything. At no fault of the host, the sidewalk outside the apartment was under construction, which was noisy beginning in morning to early afternoon. It was a bother the first day because we wanted to sleep in, but after that we were early risers. The apt. was clean, comfortable beds with clean towels and soap. The bathroom is small, clean and served its purpose. There's a washer, no dryer, but was able to borrow drying rack from roof top and that worked well. There is a small refrigerator, so we bought easy breakfast food items for our mornings. Only one of the two stove burners was working, which made it challenging, but we made it work. I would recommend your stay at this apartment and I'm sure you will enjoy yourself and much as we did.   "
20587,87109521,2016-07-18,571138,Paul,"great neighborhood and wonderful terrace.  Apartment was as advertised.  Walking distance to many of Rome's best attractions and many great, reasonably priced places to eat in the neighborhood.
"
20587,88638834,2016-07-25,7047384,Esther,"We werden verwelkomd door Paulo en in het appartementen lag een plattegrond en boekjes met wat er te doen was in Rome. 
Gelegen in leuke, levendige buurt met veel restaurantjes en bars. Schilderachtige huizen en steegjes en op loopafstand van het oude centrum."
20587,107064327,2016-10-09,24329187,Mariam,"We spent a week in Cedro Apartments and had a really good time. 

The two bedrooms are spacious. The beds are comfortable and the air conditioning works very well. Noise from the streets can be heard easily, despite closed windows.

We used the kitchen only for breakfast every morning, I think it would be a challenge to cook anything there.

The bathroom is tiny, but very useable. It takes some effort to share it with four persons.

Trastevere is a very nice area, it is easy to walk to the main sights from here. There are a LOT of nice restaurants and cool bars in the neighborhood. Public transport is also easy to reach."

20587,141112462,2017-04-02,15077983,Susanne,"Oh du schÃ¶nes Trastevere - das ideale Viertel fÃ¼r NachtschwÃ¤rmer, weniger geeignet fÃ¼r Menschen mit leichtem Schlaf ;-) Die Wohnung ist wie beschrieben, das Badezimmer etwas kleiner als dargestellt, etwas beleibtere Menschen tun sich in der kleinen Dusche tatsÃ¤chlich schwer. Die Dachterrasse ist fÃ¼r mehrere Mietwohnungen in einem Haus (5 insgesamt) statt nur eine. Das Angebot von Sabrina, fÃ¼r 50â¬ ein Taxi vom Flughafen zu organisieren ist sehr ratsam, da der Preis fÃ¼r ein regulÃ¤res Taxi in etwa der gleiche, die kleinen unwegsamen StrÃ¤Ãchen rund um die Wohnung fÃ¼r den ÃPNV nicht erschlossen sind und man auch zu FuÃ nur mÃ¼hsam mit Trolleys Ã¼ber das Kopfsteinpflaster daddelt. Wer Rom lebendig mag und gern lÃ¤nger nachts wach bleibt wird hier eine ideale Unterkunft finden - im Viertel treiben sich Einheimische, junge Leute, Familien, Senioren und Touristen gleichermaÃen herum und es ist herrlich bunt und gemischt. Insgesamt durch die Lage, die Ausstattung sowie den freundlichen Umgang mit den Vermietern ein wunderbarer Aufenthalt, den wir uns nicht schÃ¶ner hÃ¤tten wÃ¼nschen kÃ¶nnen. "
20587,151739794,2017-05-14,14516181,Britta,"Sehr schÃ¶ne, gepflegte Wohnung im lebendigen Ausgangsquartier von Rom. Sehr zentral mit wunderschÃ¶ner Terrasse. Durch die hohen Mauern, je nach Tag (Wochenende), sehr laut, da Treppenabsatz unter den Fenstern als Treffpunkt genutzt wird."
20587,153393148,2017-05-21,25737553,Mads,"Very enjoyable stay. Smooth and friendly checkin by Paulo, who also arranged a return transit to the airport. Very nice.
Clean, airy and cool (as in; not too hot). It is a professional rental apartment, not a private home.
Small kitchenette, goof for coffee and tea. ""Eggs"" right next door serves a super breakfast.
Thank you for a wonderful weekend in beautiful Rome"
20587,172000664,2017-07-19,51497286,Julie,"SÃ©jour trÃ¨s agrÃ©able dans l'appart de Sabrina. L'appartement est comme dÃ©crit dans une rue calme, et la terrasse permet un bon moment de calme aprÃ¨s avoir arpentÃ© Rome. 
Nous avons Ã©galement beaucoup apprÃ©ciÃ© le quartier, on retient l'adresse pour notre prochaine visite."
20587,175540612,2017-07-29,75450778,StefÃ¡nne,"The location of this apartment is very good. Although it is not close to some of the major sites you may want to visit in Rome. It is still in a lively community that has a vast number of restaurants, bars and stores. This in my view makes it a very good location. 

With regards to the apartment it is very small. However, this is clearly stated in the description so I was prepared for the living situation. The bathroom, however, is extremely small. So if that is a breaking point t for you, be very cautious of that when booking. 

The hosts are very accomodating, easily accessible, professional and respectful. This made communication very easy for me and the rest of persons staying at the apartment with me. 

If you are the type of traveller that like luxurious spaces in a posh neighbourhood. This is not the place for you. However, if you are like me, and want an authentic experience. In a quaint, lively Roman neighbiurhood, not needing a fancy living space. This is the place for you! 

All in all I believe this is a good apartment to stay in. "
20587,186554361,2017-08-25,9960418,Elga,"Een fijn apartment met twee ruime slaapkamers met airco, klein keukenblok in een levendige buurt met veel goede restaurantjes direct in de buurt.  Een goede uitvalsbasis om de highlights van Rome te bezoeken, ook zeer geschikt voor gezin met 1 tot 2 kinderen. Erg netjes en goed verzorgd, Sabrina is een prettige gastvrouw, aanrader!"
20587,194232406,2017-09-16,22613628,Pilar,"This apartment and the neighborhood was absolute perfection! The living area was on the smallish side (but who needs to be hanging out in the living area when you have beautiful Trastevere outside?), but both bedrooms were very roomy with VERY comfortable beds, TVs, lots of closet space and air conditioning units with remote controls. The bathroom was also small, and the shower was teeny-tiny, but it did its job! The kitchen area was fully stocked with everything we needed and we even had a washing machine which we used (we had a hard time figuring out how it worked, but after some Googling and YouTube, we figured it out). The shared rooftop was absolutely beautiful and we made sure to take advantage of it! Paolo greeted us the evening we checked in and he was so awesome! He made sure to explain everything to us and even provided us with a map of Rome with some things we should check out. He was also so nice to schedule our van transfer to the airport and our friend's taxi transfer to the train station. If we ever visit Rome again, we would totally stay at Sabrina's apartment again! Thank you so much, Sabrina and Paolo!!!!"
20587,221311506,2017-12-26,123969416,Marc,"Quiet and very clean location.  Easy walking to almost all of Rome.  
Great service, with even an early check-in no problem with Paolo. 
Beds were extra comfortable and not 100 feet from a great breakfast or late night glass of wine at Eggs.  
Stay away from the busy streets and vendors in Rome, Trastevere is the choice for a more relaxed visit."
20587,224090460,2018-01-02,3052978,Brandon,"Nice apartments that could not be situated in a better location within Trastevere; easily walkable to all restaurants and night life! The shower is a bit small however the bedrooms are large, the beds are comfortable, and the rooftop is a great place to relax! Highly recommended!"
20587,244971092,2018-03-20,56748085,Scott,"Sabrina and Paolo were great. Communication and check in went smoothly and very accommodating. Many Restaurants were close by to choose from. Central location to was ideal to explore Trestavere and Rome. All within walking distance. A bit noisy at night, several late night bars and we did stay over Saint Patrickâ Day. Sabrina did tell us Friday, Saturday and Wednesdayâs tends to be more active. Roof top terrace was great, a bottle of wine and the stars."
20587,257439018,2018-04-26,33800745,MichÃ¨le-AngÃ©lique,Ce logement est parfaitement situÃ© et agrÃ©able.  La salle de bain et la cuisine sont petites
20587,274479949,2018-06-09,189227353,Carleen,A stay right in the heart of Travastere with access to outdoor roof deck. Shower is on the small side. Perfect place to experience old world Rome.
20587,278028770,2018-06-17,63231284,Denae,"This past winter we planned our first trip to Rome for June 2018 (as I write this we returned home from Rome 2 weeks ago). As we were looking for neighborhoods to stay, we came across Sabrina's apartment. She was an accredited ""superhost"" in Trastevere with wonderful reviews listed. Sabrina was available for any questions we had prior to our trip in regard to our stay.  As Sabrina checked in with us closer to our departure date we had conversed about transportation from the airport. She did offer to arrange transportation from the airport to our apartment, but we managed to arrange a transfer on our own. The apartment manager, Paulo,  greeted us as soon as we arrived on property. He was very helpful with recommendations for dinner, maps of Rome, and was available with any questions we had. The apartment could not have been situated in a better area. We loved staying in Trastevere!!! As I read the reviews prior to booking our place, there were concerns with late night/early morning noises from the bar crowd. There was a little bit of this but not enough to dissuade us from staying here again. The quaint streets, shops and restaurants made this the place to be. Rome is very walkable (we logged 50+ miles the week we were there) which made visiting the sights a snap! The apartment itself is a bit small (the shower even smaller). This again, would not deter us from booking this apartment again! Do not plan on cooking anything at the apartment. The kitchen is essentially located in an armoire as you walk in the door. You are in Rome so the idea of cooking seems a little ridiculous anyway. A couple of days we had purchased a bottle of wine and sat on the rooftop terrace and rehashed our days. It was so peaceful!  At the end of our trip we had a bit of a problem arranging the transfer back to the airport ourselves. One text to Paulo and our transfer was taken care of! If you are looking for a fantastic meal, check out Da Enzo Trattoria! We also took a cooking class with InRomeCooking!!! Filippo was amazing! My souvenir from Rome was the extra 10 pounds I gained in gelato, pasta, and spritz!"
20587,282346573,2018-06-27,57255803,Dorcas,"Trastevere is a very nice place to stay, it does have many shops, bars and nice trattorias to have a nice dinner. The apartment is small, but silent at night, it does have nice windows for it. Not good for families, perfect for young couples."
20587,291725320,2018-07-16,130210418,Vera,Close to many sights but in quiet area.  Loved the sun terrace.  Comfortable accomodation.  Thank you.

Had two brilliant mornings drinking coffee in the sun on it, perfect start to a day exploring Rome. The area is brilliant, with lots of restaurants and little bars but the apartment is hidden away from them. Would love to stay again if I visited Rome."
20587,421876506,2019-03-10,15657512,Merve,Great location...nice terrace! The apartment was a bit smaller than pics but were enough for 4 people. Thanks to Paola for quick access
20587,424170288,2019-03-16,233403556,Caleb,The place is amazing! The location is prime to some of the best Italian food you can find. He apartment was beyond clean and everything was as said. They also made an early accommodation because our flight was changed and we arrived to early! Highly recommended to any and everyone!

L' air conditionnÃ© fonctionne parfaitement, indispensable Ã  Rome sous la canicule et prÃ©sente une excellente literie et une bonne insonorisation.
La qualitÃ© du service et la rÃ©activitÃ© de Paolo mÃ©ritent largement les 5 Ã©toiles.
La terrasse (partagÃ©e !) est un gros plus le matin et le soir, trop chaude en journÃ©e en aoÃ»t.
Dommage que la salle de bains soit petite, et que les toilettes ne soient pas indÃ©pendantes.
En rÃ©sumÃ©, nous avons passÃ© de superbes vacances dans cet appartement accueillant."

20587,615156596,2020-03-07,219297539,Tracy,"Our family (Mom, Dad, sons 22 and 20) recently stayed here for 4 nights  during our time in Rome. We had chosen this place because of the previous reviews, which mentioned location being a plus, apartment being clean and well-maintained,  and having the space that our family of 4 people needed. Everything was as stated, and we agreed with all of the positive reviews. The neighborhood is charming, we were withing walking distance of many restaurants and piazzas, and the sights of Rome were only about a 30 minute walk. We didnt use public transportation, just our feet, so I cant comment on buses/trains. Paolo was our point of contact during our stay, and he was very helpful in arranging a driver for us to take us to the airport on departure day. The only small comments I would make (and they are so small), was that I was surprised that there weren't any paper towels or dish towel in the kitchen (I know, that's kind of silly, but since we were making our own breakfast, I didnt realize that I had to provide my own). We just used a hand towel from the bathroom. I also would have liked to have seen a few more bath towels, as we each had one large one and one smaller one, with no washcloth. Yes, there is a washer, but with no dryer, we didnt want to wash any towels. So we just used the same one for all 4 days. Other than those tiny things, this place was great, and I would stay here again."
20606,95137,2010-09-12,146240,Ulrike,"We stayed here with our adult children and had a very good time.  The apartment was very clean and tidy. The location was wonderful. It was very close to St. Peter's Square, restaurants, the grocery store, and the bus stop. Giovanna was gracious in arranging transportation service to and from the airport.  She was a very gracious host. There happened to be construction work outside the building during our entire stay.  This made it pretty noisy at times, but everything else was perfect!"
20606,115509,2010-10-10,240037,Nazareno,"Giovanna was a great host, being extremely friendly and constantly making sure everything was perfect. The apartment we stayed in was massive (we were 6 and there was plenty of space for all), very well maintained and full of character. It was located close to a supermarket, a grocery and a bus stop, so everything was very convenient. I'd go there again! "

She even had a washing machine. I would definitely  stay there again.

Very clean and safe.  The only issue was the noise coming from the traffic on the street, which took a while to get used to.  So if you are a light sleeper be warned."
20606,582318,2011-09-30,490685,Kate,"We had a great time in Rome and were centrally located here at Giovanna's. Only a short walk for St Peters Square and the Vatican, we were comfortable and had plenty of space.  We were warmly welcomed and Giovanna was most helpful with how to get around, great places to eat and anything else we might need.  She even bought us champagne to help celebrate a birthday - which was most unexpected and kind.

You are close to supermarkets, restuarants and everything you need. Highly recommended - thanks Giovanna!!"

Bakery and supermarket only a few meters away from the apartment. Bus 64 stops in your street going straight to the most important sightseeings and ending in Termini Station. Host Giovanna kind and helpfull. We recommend this apartment for your stay in Rome.

The host was delightful and all our needs were met in this large, well -equipped and well-appointed home.

20606,12605646,2014-05-06,11558762,Jane,Thank you Giovana. The apartment was very nice and large.  It is in a fabulous location. We truly enjoyed our stay!
20606,13089835,2014-05-19,12676387,Mauro,"Questo appartamento Ã¨ magnificamente localizzato, a due passi da Piazza San Pietro e non lontano dai trasporti pubblici (metro e bus), ottimo per potersi spostare facilmente e visitare la cittÃ . Super e mini market disponibili nei dintorni, come anche numerosi ristoranti e trattorie.

All'interno l'appartamento Ã¨ spazioso, perfetto per un gruppo di 6-8 persone, visto che ha due grandi stanze, un'altra stanza un po' piÃ¹ piccola ma che puÃ² ospitare tranquillamente due persone, un cucinino (non fornitissimo perÃ² in termini di stoviglie e pentole), due bagni (uno di cui con doccia) e uno spazioso salotto. Essendo un gruppo di 5 adulti e 3 bambini, avevamo bisogno di molto spazio e ne abbiamo avuto a sufficienza. Essendo al primo piano con finestre a vetri singoli, c'Ã¨ rumore che proviene dalla strada di notte e al primo mattino, il che potrebbe infastidire chi ha il sonno leggero.

Al nostro arrivo tutto era pronto per il check-in e la casa era pulita. Le foto rispecchiano abbastanza bene lo stato generale della casa. La proprietaria, la signora Giovanna, Ã¨ gentilissima e molto disponibile.

Se dovessi tornare a Roma, tornerei certamente in questo appartamento.

Un consiglio: il quartiere Ã¨ molto tranquillo, ma consiglio di non fare la sciocchezza (che abbiamo fatto noi) di lasciare la macchina carica di valigie parcheggiata per strada, incustoduita..."
20606,13676215,2014-06-02,14139142,Brian,Giovanna was an excellent host!  She was very professional.  She gave us all the information to plan our trip and she is very responsive.  She took care of all our needs.  She allowed us leave our luggages before our checkin time and even after our checkout time so we can see the Pope before we left.  Her flat is spacious and comfortable.  We can see St. Peter's Basilica from the apartment and it is in fact only within about 5 minutes walk.  There are good places to eat very nearby and souvenirs and Bus 64 is only a few steps away.  We go to our favorite bakery downstairs practically every morning.   We really enjoyed our stay....great host and apartment!  We would consider staying here again next time.  
20606,14303412,2014-06-16,15105492,Courtney,"We stayed here with nine people and it was terrific! It took 5 minutes to walk to St. Peters and 40 minutes to the Colosseum. There was also a bus stop 2 minutes from the apartment that took you right to the colosseum if you didn't want to walk (the bus took about 15-20 minutes). Our host was great at helping us coordinate transportation from the airport to the apartment and met us there when we arrived. She also suggested a great bakery one minute from the apartment which was really good and a grocery store if we needed anything. We struggled with hot water because of 9 people but it is so hot in Rome, it felt great. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely return here!"
20606,19735802,2014-09-17,7190264,Jesse And Gill,Great location near to Vatican. Check in was perfect with Eduardo who was amazingly helpful! Large apartment with well equipped kitchen. 3 double bedrooms and 2 toilets. Very close to carrefour and the old town was an easy bus ride or 25 min walk away. Some traffic noise at night but ear plugs were helpful. We were very happy with this apartment.
20606,20360296,2014-09-28,3008797,Marilyne,Giovanna nous a bien accueilli et beaucoup d'informations et de guides Ã©taient disponibles dans l'appartement pour faciliter notre sÃ©jour. L'appartement est grand pour un groupe (nous Ã©tions 8). Nous avons cependant regrettÃ© que la description du logement prÃªte Ã  confusion car nous pensions qu'il s'agissait d'une maison... Nous pensions donc Ã©quilibrer le fait d'Ãªtre un peu Ã©loignÃ© du centre par le fait d'Ãªtre au calme et en fait l'appartement est au premier Ã©tage donc assez bruyant.

20606,21036936,2014-10-10,20466067,Galina,"Great  stay @ Roma!

We where travelling together with 4 adult and 1 kid 3,5 years old.
First of all i want to mentioned that Giovanna has very high level of commitment, all details where provided in advance. So there where no any bad surprises for us. 
Apartment is really spacious & perfectly clean. Looks exactly as on picture.
Located is just great for tourist perspective. First of all it's just 10 minutes walking from Vatican & San.Pete Basilica. Secondly the district not crowded and there is a lot of small local restaurants & bakery around. Carefour supermarket is 5 minutes walking. Railway, bus & taxi station all located close in a walking distance.
Third - apartments well equipped. Refrigerator, Air conditioning, washing machine, dishwasher, coffee maker, stove, microwave.  By the way, everything is ready to use because all consumable materials are already there. Such as  dish-washing detergent, laundry detergent etc.
There is also instruction of usage everywhere, so you will not be confused with new Technics.
There is also such a pleasant think as a lonely planet guide available.

So we really enjoyed staying @ Giovanna apartments, and i would safely recommend it to my friends.

Best regards,
Galina.

20606,22661571,2014-11-11,22582414,Hannah,"We were delighted with Giovanna`s apartment, it is spacious, bright, clean and it was in a fantastic location for us ( especially Mum, 80yrs) because it was a only a short walking distance to St Peter`s,  minutes walk from bus route 64 which had a regular service, restaurants and shops all just a few minutes walk  from apartment.  Giovanna was most informative and helpful in everyway possible. We can highly recommend this apartment."
20606,24359631,2014-12-27,20949502,Robert,Had a wonderful time.  Giovanna was very gracious.  Very comfortable and suited our needs well as it was so close to St. Peters.  Thank you!
20606,24551163,2014-12-30,9529291,Jon,"Giovanna was very welcoming, and although she was away when we arrived she made sure we were looked after by Ms Teresa and her very nice boys, who came over and showed us how the TV worked and sorted out our hot water issue.
"
20606,30080304,2015-04-17,5791269,Evelyn,"Giovanna was responsive and polite, and took care to show us around the house and helped with giving directions to the attractions in Rome too! Location of the apartment is great for those who wish to visit Vatican City - just a 10 min walk away! We felt very safe living in the apartment.  Something to take note is that there is only 1 shower room for an apartment that can easily fit about 7 or more people, so that can get a little tricky especially in ensuring everyone gets a share of hot water. Overall, a great first time experience for me. Thanks, Giovanna!"
20606,33229861,2015-05-26,12978557,Marc,"Wir waren im Mai 2015 in Rom. Die Wohnung liegt sehr zentral und ist sehr gerÃ¤umig. Giovanna war sehr hilfreich, hat alle Fragen beantwortet und hat auf uns gewartet, obwohl wir uns mehr als eine Stunde verspÃ¤tet hatten."
20606,37159031,2015-07-05,6562757,Anna,"So glad we booked this apartment. We had some difficulties with our accomodation and giovanna was so helpful and accomodating. She arranged another apartment for us to stay in for a couple of days before our original booking. Staying close to the Vatican was really wonderful and the gave our two small kids a place to run around at the end of each day. The street the apartment is on has great cafes and close to good restaurants. Very local feeling as opposed to touristy. An easy walk (if not too hot ;) to travestere district and all the central sites. The apartment itself (we stayed in a smaller one in the same building ) was perfect, it stayed cool even without the air con on and had everything we needed. What a very lovely and helpful host. You will not regret staying here. "
20606,40758291,2015-08-02,246859,Kerry,"Great apartment - very spacious with plenty of room for our group of 4. Nice outdoor space as well and good location - very convenient for our needs.  Giovanna was very helpful, providing us with transport advice when we requested it. "
20606,48246692,2015-09-24,15157642,Alicia,"Great unit for our family vacation. Giovanna was very flexible and patient with us even though our arrival time was delayed by about 4 hours. She was there to greet us and give us instructions on how to use the appliances etc and gave directions to the nearby free parking. She answered all of our questions and was very helpful. The unit is beautiful and very clean. Instructions in the house all included English which was very helpful. The location is a short walk from the square, and the 64 bus stop nearby  takes you straight to the colloseum which was very convenient. The restaurants nearby were all wonderful. We are already planning to return next year with more family."
20606,48700841,2015-09-28,20214897,Tad,Giovanno's flat is truly a gem in Vatican City. It's like 3 minutes walking away  from St Peter's Church. Many local cafes restaurants within 5 minutes walking. An old couple run a breakfast shop downstairs with best pastry and coffee. The flat itself is very spacious. Nothing fancy but clean and supplies with all necessities. Giovanna is very helpful and very responsive to request. If we come back again to Rome we will stay here! 
20606,49742662,2015-10-05,41431912,Jan,"My family and I were very welcomed by Giovanna.  She is very professional and accommodating.  She made our experience even more wonderful.  The apartment is immaculate and perfect for a family. The location is the best-10 minute walk from the Vatican.  The neighborhood is safe and not at all ""touristy"". We enjoyed a couple of the small restaurants and had we stayed longer would have loved to have a cooked and enjoyed the neighborhood even more.  The apartment has a lovely porch and seating for 8.  Everything was above our expectations, especially our host Giovanna, Thank You from all of us!!!"
20606,52393521,2015-10-29,35759150,Ciaran,We were welcomed warmly on arrival and given a thorough tour of the aprtment and how everything worked. The description of the apartment was very accurate. It provided us with a perfect base for our stay in Rome.
20606,58134207,2016-01-01,46318009,Amber,Great location walking distance to the vatican. Easy to get around to all of Rome's major sights. She was available to us for any questions we had daily and extremely helpful. There are two bathrooms but only one shower but it worked out fine with all eight of us after all. Carrefour in walking distance and that was also very helpful. 
20606,60754487,2016-01-27,44712337,Artur,"ByÅo super. WÅaÅcicielka bardzo pomocna â podpowiedziaÅa jak gdzie dojechaÄ. ByliÅmy z dzieÄmi â dostaliÅmy ÅÃ³Å¼eczko (turystyczne), krzeseÅko do karmienia a nawet trochÄ zabawek:).

Great apartment . All in accordance with descriptions and photos. The owner very helpful. we recommend
"
20606,71601892,2016-04-26,52880492,Cindy,"The apartment was wonderful. It is just like the pictures. Giovanna met with us when we arrived. She gave us a tour and explained how everything worked and answered our questions.  Everything was within walking distance and the bus stop is just down the road if needed. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils. The place was cozy and comfortable and great for our stay. We would definitely stay here again.
"
20606,78171982,2016-06-05,707063,Jordan,"One of my best stays in Rome.  The location and the apartment were perfect. We were a group of 10 and we all were very comfortable.

 Giovanna was so kind and explained everything in the apartment.  She was the best Airbnb host I've had in all my travels.  

Thanks again for such wonderful stay. "
20606,96754597,2016-08-24,51278422,Kerri,"Giovanna was prompt at answering all email queries prior to our relocation to Rome from Australia. She arranged an earlier check in for us too as our plane landed early in the morning. Giovanna was thorough in showing us the apartment and the facilities and provided her mobile number so that we could contact her with anything we needed throughout our stay.
We stayed with Giovanna for 6 weeks whilst we searched for our permanent home in Rome. The location was great for walking to the neighbouring suburbs - Prati (15 min walk), Campo di Fiori (20min), Trastevere (old part - 25min) Vatican (5-10min). Good selection of shops and restaurants near by. Bus and Taxis within 5 minute walk. Train Station less than 10min walk. 
The apartment was bright and basic but we (2 adults 2 children - 1yr and 2.5yr) managed to happily survive a 6 week stay :o). However, i feel the kitchen lacked space & utensils to prepare proper meals which wouldnt be a problem for a shorter stay.  The lounge was hot during the day(we stayed July & August) as no aircon but the bedrooms had aircon so sleeping was not a problem.  The bathroom was adequate - no frills but perfectly functional.  The only drawback would be that the power would cut out frequently when using more than one appliance at the same time - we couldnt use the dishwasher and the oven at the same time - or the washing machine and the dishwasher... however, im not sure if thats just a rome thing as a pose to an apartment thing.
Overall - our experience at Giovannas was a good one. She was a great host and was more than happy to help with any information needed and with any issues that arose. Thanks for having us! ;o)"
20606,98293051,2016-08-30,33181963,Katherine,"Giovanna met us at the apartment the day of check in and made sure that everything was perfect for our stay. She accommodated our baby with a high chair and a cot. The apartment has the perfect layout for large family groups with plenty of space to be together, but also plenty of places to have some quiet time. The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of shops, restaurants and cafÃ©s within walking distance. St. Peter's was also very close and the bus into the main part of the city was very convenient. We loved our stay and wished it was longer. "
20606,107873912,2016-10-13,94784702,Giovanna,"L'host Giovanna Ã¨ stata meravigliosa, molto discreta,disponibile e (Website hidden by Airbnb) quartiere era perfetto, tutto a portata di mano, con supermercati negozi e (Website hidden by Airbnb) sopratutto vicinissimo a piazza San (Website hidden by Airbnb) siamo trovati benissimo anche se Ã¨ una strada trafficata e con parcheggi sempre (Website hidden by Airbnb) con un po' di pazienza si trovava sempre qualche posto (Website hidden by Airbnb) dovessi ritornare a Roma tornerei di sicuro in questo stesso alloggio.."
20606,108376666,2016-10-16,53385305,Massimo,"Il soggiorno Ã¨ stato molto piacevole. La casa molto pulita e molto molto funzionale per piÃ¹ persone che volessero trascorrere del tempo nelle immediate vicinanze della CittÃ  del Vaticano, che dista veramente poco a piedi. Zona tranquilla di notte e ben servita di negozi giorno e notte. I proprietari sono stati gentilissimi Ã¨ molto disponibili ad esaudire le nostre richieste. Non ci Ã¨ mancato nulla. Siamo rimasti contenti e Torneremo di sicuro. Da consigliare. "
20606,139989671,2017-03-27,110510708,Erin,"Giovanna is a wonderful host and her apartment fit our family perfectly. The pictures are accurate and there is plenty of room. Some previous comment mentioned that there was only 1 shower available --  but that is no longer true. After some great remodeling, both are full bathrooms. This was a great help with 4 adults. There was a little noise traffic from the street, but it seemed to only be heard by the front bedroom. We really enjoyed the location as it had a Carrefour grocery store up the street, along with a coffee bar and gelato store just a few doors down, that was our toddler's favorite perk! Also for kids there is a small playground a street over that shares a fence with the train station, maybe 2 blocks away. Its a great family apartment or for multiple adults that want their own space. "
20606,144277022,2017-04-15,72640548,Xin,"Giovanna is welcoming and helpful, and responds to messages very quickly. This apartment is spacious for our 7 people, with everything we need during our stay, you can see from many details that Giovanna is really considerate. 
Vatican is 5-10 minutes walk and there is a 64 bus station within 5minutes walk so it's convenient for sightseeing. There are 24 hours shop and different kinds of restaurants nearby.
Overall it is one of the best airbnb I have lived."
20606,149577369,2017-05-05,34332072,Thoai,"Excellent location nearby main tourist attractions, but very quiet inside the place."
20606,157509854,2017-06-04,118475333,Patrice,"UtilisÃ© par un petit groupe, trÃ¨s bon logement adaptÃ© et bien situÃ© prÃ©s du Vatican. Bon accueil et prÃ©occupation aidante pour favoriser un bon sÃ©jour. "
20606,273468403,2018-06-06,8808483,Daniel,"What an amazing vacation for a family of 6. 
This is the perfect place to stay in Rome. 10 minute walk from the Vatican in a local nice neighborhood, and great bakery outside.
The apartment is big and cozy, fully equipped with everything we needed. 
Giovanna was very welcoming and helpful. Great to communicate with, and she helped us with local tips."
20606,288115889,2018-07-09,82161548,Lucia,"Lo mejor la ubicaciÃ³n, perfecta! Lo mejor con diferencia, a 5 minutos del Vaticano!
La casa algo vieja con muebles / colchones y algunos electrodomÃ©sticos en estado regular. No nos gustÃ³ el suplemento de nocturnidad (julio a las 20 horas sin dejar ni media hora de cortesÃ­a)."
20606,289352882,2018-07-12,188752263,Michelle,"BEAUTIFUL apartment located within an easy walk to the Vatican.  A gelato shop opened a month before our visit, right next door to this unit - what a great bonus!   A large grocery store is a few minute walk up the street, and the local restaurants (all within a 2-5 minute walk) were wonderful.   Giovanna excels in hospitality and provides wonderful tips and orientation to the area, and how to navigate the bus lines.  The pictures of this apartment are beautiful and set high expectations - our expectations were exceeded!   We stayed in the apartment 3 nights with a family of 5 (includes me and my husband, and child aged 17, 20, 22).  The apartment could have easily accommodated many more guests.   The two bathrooms were a great luxury !   Some of the much earlier reviews referenced running low on hot water with larger groups but Giovanna responded that that issue had been addressed - and our family of 5 had no problems at all.   The unit includes a washing machine that was incredibly useful to have.  All the beds were comfortable, and the overall space was perfect for everyone to spread out at the end of our long days sightseeing.   Definitely recommend this apartment!"
20606,291028127,2018-07-15,82261659,Brenda,Communication with Giovanna was easy and accurate. Location was right on the bus line to all the major sites. Taxis are also easy and affordable. Washing machine worked great. The AC was super cold which was appreciated by this family of 4!  Baby bed available. Stores and shops are a few blocks away. Train station is .3 miles away. Would stay again. 
20606,292905646,2018-07-19,81969365,David,"Close to the Vatican, and just a few minutes walk from a taxi stand and bus stops. Very spacious!"
20606,298403397,2018-07-29,112673089,Maria,"We had a fantastic stay at Giovannaâs.  The apartment is very spacious and very well equipped so perfect for a family or groups.  The location is really special, St Peters square is just a few minutes walk at the end of the same road!  Along that road is everything you would need for an easy stay, a central bus line stop, an ice-cream shop, take out pizza/panini shop as well as cafes, bakers, restuarants and convenience stores some that are open virtually 24/7. There is also a taxi rank.  Giovanna made us feel very welcome spending time at check-in to share local tips and answer our questions,  as a local she provided all the information we needed and was contactable throughout our stay. We would recommend a stay here and would look forward to returning again one day!  "
20606,313244238,2018-08-25,14653750,NoÃ«lle,"SÃ©jour trÃ¨s agrÃ©able dans un appartement trÃ¨s bien situÃ©, proche de la place Saint Pierre et de nombreux commerces et restaurants. Le box privÃ© pour la voiture est un atout indÃ©niable, de mÃªme que la bonne isolation thermique et acoustique de l'appartement. Check-in facile, et bonne communication. Merci pour tout!!"
20606,322478295,2018-09-13,12380541,Michael,"We looked at a lot of options to stay in Rome and were very pleased to have chosen this apartment.
1 - Location
 Location is great, close to St Peters, but quiet at night and list of local amenities - the 24 hour supermarket is really handy and lots of other shops restaurants/bars nearby. Walkable to historic Rome in half hour
2- Space
The apartment is airy, bright,clean ,spacious and the outside balcony and air con is a real bonus in the September heat.
Beds are comfortable and both showers work really well - I believe this can be rare in some Rome apartments 
3. Communication 
Giovanna was really quick and helpful before and during the stay. This is hugely reassuring on Airbnb. Very friendly welcome and the house has a book with lots of helpful info on transport and local shops / trattoria / pizza places. I would say it is the most helpful guide in any rented apartment I have ever seen.
There were 4 of us staying so plenty of room, the house would comfortably accommodate 3 couples or 2 couples / 2 children in the 3 double bedrooms.

I would thoroughly recommend Giovanna's apartment a D it would be great if all Airbnb was like this!"

20606,449272205,2019-05-06,238756116,Jan,"An ideal place to stay only 5mins from St Peters  Square , quiet and more residential  than touristy, some good restaurants close by."
20606,454942534,2019-05-19,205118194,Brian,"Location, Location, Location!!!  This apartment was perfectly located for our trip to Rome.  We arrived on a Sunday and left the next Sunday.  The communication before our trip was just right.  Everything was exactly as expected.  The apartment is 3 blocks from St. Peter's Square.  So simple!!  There is a taxi stand about a block away.  Several coffee shops (called bars), pastry shops, restaurants, and small grocery markets within 2 blocks.  Super easy.  We were a family of 7.  Each person had their own bed, which was very nice!!  The kitchen is small but very useful.  We also enjoyed having a washing machine.  There is a balcony that is larger than we expected as it wraps around the apartment.  You can view parts of St. Peters dome and facade from the balcony.  Our time in Rome was rainy and chilly so we did not use the balcony much, but during warm weather I can see that this would be a nice feature.  Having 2 bathrooms was also a huge bonus!!  This was our first time as a family using Airbnb.  We were not disappointed.  I would recommend Giovanna and her apartment to any of my family or friends.  In fact, I hope to stay with her again myself!!  Happy travels!!!"
20606,471299652,2019-06-17,252337500,Sujatha,"Giovannaâs place is everything we needed, and more.  The space was large, with nice sized bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (with instant hot water) and the sitting area was a great place to hang out after a long day.  Air conditioning in the bedrooms were a great relief after sightseeing in the heat.  The washer was great - though itâs much smaller than U.S. standards, it worked very well. We put the clothes hanger on the front balcony, and our clothes dried within a half day.  The location is fantastic.  Itâs a quiet area, but just a 10 minute walk to St.Peterâs basilica.  Spoons, the gelato place, is just next door, and there are many restaurants and coffee bars within a few minutesâs walk.  One of our favorite restaurants was Perdincibacco, which was just a 5 minute walk away. Best of all, Giovanna was a wonderful hostess.  She quickly responded to all communications, and provided a lot of information about Rome.  We would love to stay here again, on our next trip to Rome."
20606,521678339,2019-09-01,82594209,JÃ©rÃ©mie,Very smooth process and communication - super clean appartment just 200m from St Peter square.

20606,612228513,2020-02-29,270061522,Kimberly,"This is the second trip to Rome that I have stayed with Giovanna.  Each time she has accommodated our groups of 6-10 people with her stylish apartments.  As a host, she was responsive to requests.  We needed to add a 6th guest and she moved us to one of her 3 apartments to help us.  She changed out double beds for all twins upon our request.

The apartments have kitchens with a dishwasher, gas stove and oven and refrigerator.  Even a washing machine is on the back balcony.  The front balcony was equipped with comfortable furniture to enjoy the outdoors.  The furniture in the living room provides 3 couches for visiting and a large dining table for meals.  

The location is near several food markets, restaurants, pastry/esspresso and gelato shops abound. We felt very safe walking in the neighbor hood at all times of the day.  Our favorite was walking through St. Peter's square each trip.  A walk along the Tiber lead to either the Colleseum or Trastevere.  A nearby taxi stand was helpful for trips to the Borghese Gallery.  We were very pleased with our Roman Holiday!"
20606,702460105,2020-10-21,9606037,Sarah,"Giovanna was a very friendly and helpful host with a very clean, bright and spacious apartment. It was much bigger than we thought it would be. It has a large balcony that we ate breakfast on every morning. The beds and bedding are extremely comfortable and our familyâs favorite ones on the whole trip. The apartment is a short walk from the S. Pietro train station where we arrived. At first, we thought we were far away from all of the action but that is the area coming from the train station. We soon discovered that if we walked the opposite direction from the apartment, we were only 5 minutes from the Vatican and 15-25 minutes from lots of main plazas-restaurants and shops. We walked everywhere on foot from the apt for 6 days and saw all the major sites (5-7.8 miles per day). I highly recommend this place if you donât mind staying away from the heart of city/shops/restaurants and main plazas. Itâs perfectly located for touring the Vatican. Great Wi-Fi too. Our family of four enjoyed this place!"
20699,92943,2010-09-08,222326,Erika,The host canceled my reservation.
20699,411652,2011-08-01,437213,Monika,"We were three days in Rome and Frank's House was the perfect accommodation for us: very friendly host, nice arrangement, clean and really in the center of Rome. Just great :-)

We would stay again with Frank ... it was surely not our last rip to beautyful Rome!!"
20699,861214,2012-01-14,1449375,Priti,My FiancÃ© & I stayed at Frank's House for two weeks in January. Frank & his wife Soledad are really helpful and kind. They helped us out a lot and told us where to go and how to get there. The room was amazing and clean also very private. It's really close to the Colosseum. It's a 10 -15 minute walk.  We had to leave a bit early due to some circumstances but we would definitely stay here again. 
20699,880997,2012-01-24,1567728,Marguerite,"We spend 3 perfect days at Frank's place. He was a friendly host, giving some advices and adresses to visit Rome. His place is really pleasant, very well arranged and clean. We will stay again at his place with pleasure if we go back in this beautiful city !"
20699,945493,2012-02-24,1575801,Vanessa & David,"Nice place near the train station in Rome! Frank wasn't there that weekend, so he had a friend let us into the flat. Very well kept, clean, comfy bed and good location! Not extremely close to tourist spots, but all of Rome is relatively walk-able. Thanks for the nice visit! "
20699,987950,2012-03-11,1674393,Ekaterina,"We had a wonderful time at Frank's house. Everything was perfect - the apartment, the welcoming part, the geographical position. And Frank was very nice to answer to all questions and inqueries (though he wasn't in Rome at that time). He recommended several places to go out and they were great. 

Thank you and your friend for a wonderful stay in Rome."
20699,1112852,2012-04-12,1352218,Kim,"Frank's place was comfortable, clean and we loved that it reminded us of our own place... except it was in Rome! It was the perfect place to stay after a long flight from Bangkok. We were also pleasantly surprised with its accessibility to another metro station Vittorio Emmanuel and its multicultural neighborhood. The apartment's proximity to the famous gelateria Fassi and restaurant Hosteria Angelino's came in very handy for our tummies after a day of exploring. Frank was also very flexible with the schedules, kept our luggage for us while we were in Florence and Paris. That meant so much to us. Thanks Frank!"
20699,1380997,2012-05-30,1663806,Traci,"Frank made everything so easy.... he arranged a car from the airport which was exactly what we needed after a long-haul flight.   He was at the apartment to meet us and immediately gave us a map and his recommendations for sights and restaurants.    
The location was handy for Termini and the metro is only steps away so it was convenient without being right in the heart of the tourist districts.
I would recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to feel like a local, not a tourist, when in Rome.   "
20699,1862472,2012-08-01,2798208,Zhar,"First and foremost, Frank is an amazing person, courteous, knowledgeable and insightful, which is reflected in his style and attitude. He is a rare kind of person, a foreigner and Italian at the same time, which helped us a lot in our 3-day stay in Rome. The best breakfast place he recommended seemed like the best breakfast place, as was the best gelato shop in the world. 

The place is amazing, from ceiling to pillows, all touched by style and care. Best place Iâve been so farâ¦"
20699,1882473,2012-08-04,2384946,Jas,very helpful host and handy location (close to Metro & Train Station)
20699,2268911,2012-09-11,3150725,Linda,"I was traveling in Italy and stopped in Rome on three occasions, and two of the times I stayed at Frank's. The first time we stayed in the room with the Private Bath - the second time the smaller room. First off, Frank is an exceptional host, and the set up for this place is very convenient. You have everything you need, and just in case, Frank is available to help. Both rooms and the entire place itself is clean, updated, trendy with a very comfortable bed, but also very quaint - the larger room has a small balcony that opens up to the street. Everything is accounted for, and there are even travel guides available to plan for your stay. It is very close to the train station and central to getting wherever needed in Rome. Frank was very good with communication and directions. My trip was last September, and I am STILL thinking about how great of an experience it was to stay at Frank's place. For the price, you get a great value, especially because hotels in Rome are overpriced and often very dingy/uncomfortable. The larger room has plenty of space for two, the smaller one is cozy for two and great for one. Its great for a trip where you won't spend too much time in the room (say for meals, since there is no kitchen access) but great if you want to come back to the room and relax for longer periods. There is a small fridge to keep food and drinks (in the larger room, don't remember if there is one in the smaller room)...and other amenities as well! Can't thank Frank enough for a great stay!! "
20699,2357001,2012-09-20,2329725,Eduard,"I can recommend Franks home for couples or single travelers. It's well located. Close to the railways station. 15 min to Colleseum and 100 m to the closest metro. Frank was very helpfull and really friendly.
"
20699,3023503,2012-12-04,3505467,Richa Khurana,"Great stay, gracious host... Very well informed about areas around... Tastefully done rooms and well ventilated.
Thank you for having us over"
20699,3156562,2012-12-25,4429086,Amanda,"Thank you Frank and Soledad :)  I had an unbelievable Roman Holiday!  (I stayed over Christmas.)  I would recommend this location to anyone wanting to stay in Rome.  The location could not be better, in walking distance to EVERYTHING!  
I left my heart in Rome...

When can I move in?  :)"
20699,3396803,2013-01-22,4079036,Hannah,Frank and Soledad did a wonderful job!  They truly thought of everything and the accommodation was superbly clean and comfortable.  I appreciated that they made themselves available for assistance if needed and were very welcoming.  I highly recommend staying here!
20699,4218301,2013-04-19,4687012,Jennifer,"A wonderful first experience with Airbnb! My husband and I were looking for a place near Termini (train & metro station), with free wifi, and English-speaking hosts. Frank's Place fit the bill and then exceeded all our expectations. From my first inquiry through checkout, Frank was friendly, helpful, and extremely prompt in his communications. We booked a bit last-minute, and Frank offered us a deal. Even though we arrived over an hour later than we had planned, Frank took the time to provide us recommendations and direction for numerous sights and restaurants. We stayed in the room with the private bathroom (gold chandelier and taupe duvet in the photos)--a free upgrade from the room we had booked! It is EXACTLY as pictured--clean, bright, large, and well-maintained. The Vittorio Emanuele metro stop is within easy walking distance (Termini is probably about a 10-minute walk), and there's a lovely park nearby. Getting a cab in the area wasn't a problem. The street the balcony faces is a little noisy, and I was awakened in the morning occasionally by traffic noise. But I'm a very light sleeper, and even I was able to promptly fall back asleep without a problem. The building itself is very quiet (I was glad to finally stay somewhere I couldn't hear the toilet above me flushing or my neighbor coughing!). Frank's Place consists of three rooms that share an entrance/foyer in a typical apartment building. The property isn't ""staffed"" like you might expect at a hotel (one of the reasons I was afraid to try Airbandb), but Frank seems to be available 24/7. I emailed him with a question around 10pm, and I had a response within minutes! He was also there at checkout time with a cleaning staff, so he is definitely around and on top of things. About the room: Hand and bar soap and cotton pads were provided. The mattress was comfortable (softer than European hotel mattresses, in my experience) and the linens were nice. Wifi worked great. Frank and Soledad obviously take the time to think of the details--the decor is simple and homey, and the fresh flowers and potted plants are great touches. There's a wine fridge, set of glasses, and bottle opener in the room. :) There are travel books, magazines, and playing cards available too. There isn't an alarm clock or full-length mirror in the room (not a problem for us, just pointing it out in case anyone relies on their accommodations to provide them.) We were able to leave our bags after check out and pick them up at our convenience. I'm generally very critical and I wasn't sure what to expect from an Airbandb experience. If they're all like this, though, we'll never stay in a regular hotel again! I was able to peek in one of the other rooms, and it looked lovely as well. We highly recommend the property and Frank as a host (unfortunately, we never met Soledad). We stayed here April 2013."

we are absolutely  satisfied with all thing "
20699,6304492,2013-08-07,7156603,Hey Ran,"I stayed 4nights frank house! Room is fantastic, very spacious and clean like 4 star hotel.  I will stay definitely at frank house if i go back to Rome. "
20699,7153518,2013-09-09,5384248,Sanne,"We had a great stay in Rome! Frank's place was very nice, cosy and clean. Comfy beds, a nice shower and we also enjoyed the little balcony. Frank gave us a very warm welcome and shared some names of great restaurants and bars with us. The location is a little too close to the railwaystation for my taste. But the metro is very close so it's easy to get into the city. "
20699,7563261,2013-09-24,1747037,Vesna,"Loved the stay at Frank & Soledad. Very good location, spacious and clean rooms.. Frank was very helpful with information about the city as well. 
I have stayed in both room with ensuite and shared bathroom. Definately prefer the ensuite, go for that. Would definately return."
20699,8463541,2013-11-01,5802060,Ricardo,"The apartment is very close to the main train/subway station in Rome, so it's easy to grab a metro to anywhere to want to go in Rome. However, if your destination is the Colosseum, you might also choose to walk there(20 minutes?). The host lives on the same building so they are available to should you have a problem. The apartment is very clean and comfortable. We had no problems whatsoever with the apartment."
20699,9173036,2013-12-10,10364950,Marcel,"Sitio encantador y ciudad fantÃ¡stica. La atenciÃ³n de Frank fue inmejorable, todo de 10."

20699,10416669,2014-02-18,9405366,Jelke,We really enjoyed our stay in this charming and spacious room. Tom & Jelke
20699,10767617,2014-03-06,10118921,Giray,"I have never met a host like Frank. He is so helpful, tried to answer all our questions and tried to provide our nedds. His suggestions about the restaurants and cafes nearby are very beneficial. His apartment is very well located, 10 minutes walk to Termini, 2 minutes walk to metro and tram stations. There are many shops, supermarkets, restaurants, cafes near to the apatment. According to his guidance, we were able to walk everywhere in central Rome and managed to visit all atractions. 
Thanks to Frank ; we spent really good time in Rome listening to his advices.     "
20699,10860848,2014-03-10,6324211,Scott,"This is why we only travel AirBNB anymore.  We arrived and Frank sat down with us for at least 30 minutes with a map to show us everything that we would need or want to see.  Sights, restaurants, coffee houses, gelato spots, and every type of local train and bus info.  He marked it all on the map and thus made the first few days of our trip to Italy so much easier.  I was able to message him and always got an answer, even for info not related to the room (such as train info).  Also the room itself is just as beautiful as the pictures show it to be.  Stunning with really tall ceilings that make it feel very roomy.  Pleasure to stay in this room and with this host!"
20699,12072213,2014-04-22,13234334,Tripurari,"WOW! will be understatement. Really awesome host Frank was. He took the pain to explain us all the stuff about rome making it a very very memorable experience for us. The room was clean. Though its smaller than what it looks like in picture  but the interiors are done very well and are intelligent use of space. It is very well accessible to almost all the major attractions in the rome and very near to metro stop

Would definitely recommend this !"
20699,12385360,2014-04-30,14640768,Rafael,"Una habitaciÃ³n encantadora, todo muy limpio y acogedor, la verdad es que nos sentimos como en nuestra propia casa.
Frank fue muy amable porque nada mÃ¡s llegar nos mostrÃ³ los lugares de mÃ¡s interÃ©s y una lista de restaurantes baratos y que nos dejaron impresionados.
Muy recomendable para ver Roma!!
"
20699,13365416,2014-05-26,12159245,Jane,"We had such a wonderful time staying at Frank and Soledad's suite during our trip to Rome, I'd even say it was a highlight! Frank was far and away the most considerate and helpful host I've ever encountered. In fact, we had the most incredible meal of all in Rome because he suggested and then booked us dinner there. The couple beside us at dinner had made reservations 5 months in advance! 

The suite itself is simply gorgeous. Though slightly smaller than the photos suggested, the bright airiness and beautiful furnishings made it perfectly comfortable. The location is right next to the train station so very convenient and if you're up for walking (we're New Yorkers so that's a given) then it can feel pretty central. A real steal for the price! Thanks again and would stay here again on our next trip 100%. "
20699,13908314,2014-06-08,12090075,Juliana,"We arrived in Rome late at night but Frank was onsite, greeting us right away and really took the time to show us a map of Rome, pointing out some ""local"" restaurants and tips for sightseeing - which were all VERY useful.  The room was beautiful, with a very nice bathroom (with a great relaxing shower). The location was good but the place was a bit noisy with traffic outside, especially in the morning (but then again, it's Rome!). He was such a nice host and we were glad to have stayed at his place."
20699,14095680,2014-06-11,11746421,Martina,Perfect accommodation for visiting Rome. The room with the little balcony is clean and adorable. Frank is very helpful. We will be back! 
20699,14473591,2014-06-20,15196885,Jack,"Frsnk was a wonderful host. We arrived late due to a flight delay, and he welcomed us warmly and gave us lots of information to help us navigate our way through Rome. We went to judt about all the restaurants he recommended. They were excellent. The room was clean, comfortable and beautifully furnished. We highly recommend Frsnk a d Soledad's place."
20699,14644784,2014-06-23,15632611,Kwok Hang,"We stayed in Frank's place for 2nights. It's  definitely a good experience,  close location, beautiful room with nice view and tasteful furniture and most important, a good host!  He gave us a good map and give us the idea where to eat, how to plan the route..this is all you need when you first enter this country. And the tips he gave us to aware of thief, we definitely have a good start in Italy!"
20699,14757607,2014-06-25,8352638,Eddie,"I recently travelled to Rome for a long weekend and stayed in Frank's apartment on the Eastern side of the city.

The apartment is in a great location. It is about a 10 minute walk from Termini (the main train/bus station from the airport), or one stop on the underground Metro. The apartment has a Metro station (Vittorio Emanuele) very close which leads to most tourist attractions in Rome. The Colosseum is also around a 15 minute downhill walk from the apartment. So you can get everywhere you will probably want to go very easily.

The apartment itself is beautiful. Very clean, great facilities (private bathroom, TV, hair dryer, balcony) and a very generous size. Its high ceilings and decor make it feel very Italian indeed.

But the main reason I would recommend this apartment is the host, Frank. At the time of booking, Frank was very helpful in terms of giving advice on how to get into Rome etc. When we arrived, he spent half an hour with us talking us through the city with a map that he expertly annotated. Having lived in Rome for 14 years, and hailing from the US, he was extremely knowledgeable on all the main tourist attractions, when to go, how to get there etc, as well as having great local knowledge of the less touristy restaurants, bars, and areas in Rome. Frank sat us down with a map and spoke us through every area of Rome we might like to visit - this even felt tailored to the amount of time we had and what we might personally like to do. This was exactly what we needed, having arrived without and itinerary or idea of what we were going to do.

Our time in Rome was absolutely spectacular, and this was really aided by Frank's knowledge and advice. We were able to visit all of the tourist attractions, and also had plenty of time to roam the streets of Rome, soak up the true local culture and explore the back streets behind the crowds of tourists."
20699,15238541,2014-07-05,15573598,Dominique,"We were happy that we stayed at Franks rather than a hotel. The photo description was pretty accurate and the room met with expectations. Frank gave us a couple of good tips and was good with communication. The only negatives were that I expected the bar fridge to function and it wasn't, however, Frank pretty much made up for it by being accommodating. Also the area was very handy but a little seedy. I would recommend as a place to stay for those on a budget, wanting somewhere close to the main transport hub and those after more personal accomodation."
20699,15911249,2014-07-18,14840143,Gaerik,"Needless to say, Frank is a great host and was readily available. 
The house is really close to one of the metro stations, Vittorio Emmanuele. 

The room was clean and exactly as described in the photographs and the the description. 

We had a hassle-free stay. Thanks Frank!"
20699,16124565,2014-07-22,8846529,Fabienne,"We enjoyed our stay at Frank and Soledad's apartment very much. Their assistant Jonathan welcomed us and let us feel at home immediately. He was very helpful by showing us nice Restaurants and Bars on the map and we could contact him everytime we had some questions.
The room itself is very nicely furnished, clean and perfectly located, as it lies just next to a metro station and only a 10 minutes walk from the Colosseum and the Termini train station.
We would definetly like to come again the next time we are in Rome."
20699,16726860,2014-08-01,6064281,Steven,Apartment was spacious conveniently located. Jonathan gave us great recommendations. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to any of our friends!
20699,16891587,2014-08-04,3690973,Virginie,"Very professional service. Extremely clean and a true reflection of the posting (great high ceilings). Location is excellent in terms of proximity to Termini (main train station for entering/exiting Rome and main bus station) and a metro line. Frank was away but was very helpful by providing detailed information, and his assistant Jonathan did an excellent job of settling us in (and saving us when we left our keys inside!). 

Our only suggestion is to get familiar with Rome's buses, as walking back from areas such as Trastevere (great   food / bars) is a bit of a hike and cabs aren't a great option. 

We would definitely stay here again (and hope to be able to in the near future). "

Frank is een prima gastheer, wij kregen een warm welkom. Frank nam de tijd om een plattegrond in te vullen met allerlei tips, bus nummers, wijnbars en restaurantjes. De restaurants rondom het huis zijn een aanrader, je eet bij en met de locals!
De kamers zijn smaakvol ingericht en ruim. Al met al een aanrader. "

When we arrived Frank gave us great recommendations for places to eat, things to do, and how to navigate the city. Following his map and suggestions we were able to see so much of Rome in the short time we were there! The suite is beautiful and provides a relaxing and romantic atmosphere, and it comes equipped with many essentials (hair dryer, bottle opener, wine glasses, ect.). The location is great- the Colosseum is within walking distance and there are metro stops nearby. We had a great time and we are so happy with our choice in booking this suite!

20699,24559515,2014-12-30,24872490,Michael,"The suite was just as advertised, and we enjoyed our stay very much.  It is very conveniently located near Rome's main train station (which was important to us do to an early morning departure), while literally a half-block away from Line A (the main line) of the city's subway.  We walked a couple times to the Colosseum, and enjoyed the restaurants and patisseries in the neighborhood that were recommended.  Frank greeted us at our arrival, and was fantastic in providing maps, giving us an introduction to Rome, and helping us figure out our logistics -- on its own worth a stay!  This listing was everything we had hoped!"

The rooms of the apartment are fantastic and were very clean. Our room had a connection to a private bathroom, which was very likeable. 

Before Frank handed us the keys, we had nice talk about the city. He gave us so many tips. He showed us many places on a map and marked them for us, so we could plan our tours through Rome easily.
Also his advices for restaurants and gelaterias  in the neighborhood were very valuable for us.

All in all it was a great trip for us to this awesome city!"
20699,27948906,2015-03-15,25715817,Emily,"Frank was so sweet and helpful! He took time to show us on a map the best places to eat, drink, etc. Also, the room is gorgeous! Very comfy, clean, and charming. "

20699,32450435,2015-05-18,24054294,Anne,Communication with our host was great - Frank made an effort to meet us at the street corner as it was night time and we were unsure of where to go
20699,33231149,2015-05-26,12419233,Stella,"Lovely room in Room! We stayed in Rome for around 4 days and spent all of our nights in Franks apartment. It just looks exactly the same as the photo!! Room is very clean and have everything inside. Frank is very helpful as well. We only met him the first day we checked in, but he gave us a lot of information about Rome! It was really really helpful! I would recommend this place to anyone who would love to visit Rome later in the future. "
20699,33444687,2015-05-28,31052921,Dongming,"Memorable stay. 
We spend 2 perfect days at Frank's place. He was a very friendly host, giving some advices and adresses to visit Rome. His place is really pleasant, very well arranged and clean. We will stay again at his place with pleasure if we go back in this great city !"
20699,33923569,2015-06-02,6293728,Rachael,"Frank was a great host, telling us all about the area and local restaurants when we arrived. The room was lovely and clean and very convenient for the Termini and central Rome. We had a great time - thank you Frank! We'd also highly recommend Roscioli deli (which Frank recommended to us) if you are looking for picnic treats!"
20699,34074510,2015-06-04,30931302,Sarah,"This apartment is perfect. It's a short walking distance from the train station and many of the major sites such as the colosseum and roman forum. The apartment is beautiful and very comfortable. Frank is extremely helpful and kind and gives excellent advice on places to eat, sites to visit, and how to get to all of them. We highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again!"
20699,34188035,2015-06-06,25819979,Donna,"Frank was waiting for us we didn't even need to ring the bell. The apartment was clean and fresh. Frank had the best recommendations for dinner and gelato, we would never have found these being a tourist. Thank you so much for such an enjoyable stay :)"
20699,35688590,2015-06-21,9726747,Bertrand,"We spent two marvelous nights at Frank & Soledad's flat. The place is really great, exactly like in the picture. Frank was a formidable host. He took the time to explain everything around the appartment and what to see in the city. His advices were really great. We definitely recommand their place. Thank you Frank for our wonderful time in Roma! "
20699,36768644,2015-07-01,22483549,Katherine,We had a lovely time at Franks Apartment. It's easy to find and great for exploring Rome. 
20699,37862915,2015-07-11,33775825,June,"Wonderful stay at Frank's house in Rome. Comfortable room and Frank was a very helpful and welcoming host. The room was lovely and although not in the greatest area, it was very convenient to sites and the metro"
20699,38099479,2015-07-13,21167855,Jessica,"Frank was incredibly friendly and helpful and the place was beautiful. We did get lost walking to the place which was our fault, but we realized that we could have taken the metro from the bus station to a stop right outside the apartment. While it was not a far walk at all (had we not gotten lost), this might be good for hot days and lots of luggage. Frank also let us store our luggage at the place after check out! This was incredibly nice! "
20699,39927788,2015-07-27,32208466,Elisabeth,"This room was very beautiful, clean and spacious. We had everything we needed and Frank gave us amazing restaurant suggestions :) I highly recommend!"
20699,40899055,2015-08-03,30983951,Chandra,"Frank greeted me at the door when I arrived with the most amazing warm spirit. He made sure to give me all of the information that I would need to get around the city and some local deals to restaurants in the vicinity. You only need to have a 10 minute conversation with Frank about what you want to do on your visit and he will not steer you wrong.

He knows everything about everything and he is a fantastic host. I would recommend this place to anyone.
"
20699,43398491,2015-08-19,37826537,Oliver,"An excellent experience and an excellent host. The accommodation was to a very high standard, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was modern and stylish, and the ac was much appreciated! 

Frank was the consumate host, giving us an excellent briefing on what to do, where to eat, and plenty of hints and tips. His local knowledge and personality made us feel very welcome and and enhanced our trip to Rome considerably.

Overall when I return to Rome I hope very much to stay once again in the apartment. I only wish we had booked to stay longer!"
20699,44108396,2015-08-24,5717936,Sonay,"Frank's room was very clean and well equipped. Although it is a single room, not the whole apartment, the attached bathroom gives the you privacy you need. Frank was friendly, met us at the entrance and provided the details about the place. The apartment is located at a multicultural district 15-20 mins walking distance from Colloseum. There is a subway stop nearby, but after certain hours at night you might need a cab."
20699,44792844,2015-08-29,34141333,Enrico,"The room was beautifull, it was very clean and cozy, with it's own bathroom and a good view of the street. It's even equiped with an air conditioner for hot summer days. It's close to many places, from historical to great restaurants, and walking distance from Roma Termini train station.
I met Frank when I arrived, he was very nice, gently and took time to explain my how everything works, as well as tips for places to visit using a map, and good places to eat nearby.
I had no problems during my stay, would recomend this place for anyone thinking on spend sometime in Rome, it's definitely worth it!
Thank you Frank and Soledad for letting me stay!"
20699,45936108,2015-09-07,34390668,Kyoungsil,"Good location, friendly host! The place was exactly the same as the pictures and even better than our expectation! will definitely come back to this place.

20699,46271045,2015-09-09,2188736,Lawrence,"Frank was the perfect host! He met us at the accommodation address and went an extra mile by showing us the city of Rome (places to see and eat) on a map.

The room is as per the pictures and you have your own private bathroom. There are 2 other tenants in other rooms with a shared bathroom. The bathroom condition was as per pictures, though the water pressure is weak.

The location of this place is just 2 mins walk to the nearest metro, Vittoria Emmanuale station, and we only took 10-15 mins to walk from Termini to this place with our luggage. The area is safe, though the people hanging around seems to be non-Italian, more Indians and Chinese who work in Rome. 

It's also a short 10-15 min walk to the Coliseum. 

Overall, location wise, this is quite ideal!"

20699,50269267,2015-10-11,34742864,Catharine,"Frank was an excellent host. He spent a generous amount of time helping us map out our strategy for 'doing' Rome.

We spent the first two nights in a large, private space room and loved it. Very convenient location.  We had agreed in advance to move to another room for the remainder of our stay. This space was nice because it also had a small kitchen which was shared space with another adjoining room.  We would stay in the first room again but not the second. The second had a shower and bathroom too small for our liking. Also, the shared space would have been nice had the other guests been somewhat sociable.  Their lack of sociability made sharing the common area a bit awkward.  This space might be perfect for two couples or a small group of friends travelling together.

We couldn't ask for a better host than Frank.  "
20699,50756562,2015-10-14,7901249,Yesenia,"Frank & Soledad's place was great! The first night we stayed just a floor above what we had originally booked and then transferred to the booked room. Both rooms were great -- 5th floor room had a comfier bed; 4th floor room was larger with a small balcony. 
The location was perfect as it allowed us to catch a train clear across town and also walk to/from the main terminal for arrival and departure. 
Frank was very responsive leading up to our arrival and even took time to show us all the must-sees on a map. He was extremely helpful.
We walked to all the major tour spots (except Vatican--that's where the train came in handy) and always found neat neighborhoods on our walks back to the room. 
I'd highly recommend for anyone wanting to walk/explore Rome and also have an ease of access when first arriving. Far, far better of an experience than staying in a hotel in the city center. "
20699,51274478,2015-10-19,3747637,Alicia,"Frank nos esperÃ³ para recibirnos en relidad nos quedamos en otro apto no en el de la foto muy bien arreglado y comodo.
La zona cerca de la estaciÃ³n se llega caminando y se puede recorrer Roma sin problema a pie desde allÃ­. "
20699,53241974,2015-11-07,12820290,Hannah,"Very helpful and communicate well. Frank met us on arrival and spent some time explaining Rome, where to go and how to get there. Place was very clean and a beautiful room. Private from the other guests. Our room had a balcony to the front street and got quite noisy in the night, even with the door closed (I heard car alarms and police) if you are a light sleeper. And we had problems with the shower: low pressure and turning hot/cold extremes. Walkable to station and other sights in Roma, but area seemed a little rough for my liking. "
20699,53811657,2015-11-13,7390821,Stephanie,"From the time I booked the guest house, Frank immediately contacted me on how to get to their place. He even booked us a cab. Check in was such a breeze. The room is exactly in the picture. I found it spacious. Everything was clean and amenities were provided. The guesthouse is on the 4th floor, but there's a lift(yey). Air Condition and shower seems to be working fine. The building is not really super central but the metro is probably just a five minute or less walk, so its very convenient. During our stay, Frank would even check on us if we have any concerns. Upon check out, he even called a can taxi for us. So overall a great experience. "
20699,54294915,2015-11-17,4994043,Vlade,"Frank's place played a significant part in our amazing experience in Rome.

Clean, spacious, with all amenities it has an old city charm and comfort of a modern hotel. Location makes it perfect for trips to all Rome attractions and the train station.

Frank was incredibly helpful from the first email upon booking. When we arrived he provided a map of Rome and outlined the places of interest and the best routes to reach them.

I would recommend staying at this place if you want to avoid any hassle with accommodation."
20699,54497722,2015-11-21,1213229,Steve,"Frank was available when we arrived to check us in and provided us with excellent information on places nearby for meals and exploring.  The location was ideal for our needs, interests, and budget.  The suite was clean, roomy, and as presented in the photos.  The best was the nearby gelateria, Giovanni Fassi!"
20699,55356227,2015-12-01,6173032,Shuqi,Frank is a very friendly host and gave good recommendations about shops and restaurants in Rome. The room was very spacious as described and it was clean as well. It is located near Roma Termini and had a metro station nearby which made exploring Rome much more convenient. We had a pleasant and comfortable stay at Frank's. 
20699,55624265,2015-12-03,31307687,Sarah Nell,"This was the perfect place to call home while exploring rome for a few days! It's close to a lot of exciting things to see, but still close enough to the train station that I never had anxiety about being late for my trip out, etc. The room was lovely, had everything I needed and the bed was super comfortable and cozy. Frank checked me in and gave me the rundown of different things I might like / places to see which definitely made it clear I did not book enough time to see Rome!"
20699,56585961,2015-12-15,35202957,Brooke,Our experience was great! Nice location. We would definitely stay here again

20699,60319360,2016-01-22,3916258,Lauren,"Frank was fabulous in providing us with extensive information on the surrounding area, attractions and how to get around Rome. The room is in a great location - an easy 10 minute walk to the Colosseum (which became our morning tradition), right next to a metro stop and a quick 10 minute walk to the main Termini train station. Rome itself is quite flat and we managed to walk everywhere very easily. Frank's recommendations of where to eat/drink where spot on! Indeed, we went to Panella every morning (and multiple afternoons) for delicious pastries and the best caffe with zabaglione i've ever had! 
The room itself was spacious, warm and spotless! The bed was super comfortable and the heating was very efficient. Frank was great with communication when we did need to get in contact. We absolutely loved our stay in Rome, and would definitely stay here again!"
20699,62239188,2016-02-13,39552574,Hilary,"Room was ok. Very clean and the person who greeted us was kind and helpful.  
Close to metro station but that was only good because you wanted to get away from the neighborhood as quickly as possible. There was graffiti everywhere and garbage in the streets. It was one of the lower quality areas of Rome that we saw. Above ground trains are on the street right next to the apartment and every time one went by the place would shake. Also, loud people were frequently talking in the street late into the night. Take a look at (Hidden by Airbnb) street view to see for yourself. 

Room was recently updated but bathroom had odd fogged, glass door that made it a bit awkward at times...Also, the locks into the apartment were very temperamental and often needed to be turned every which way to unlock.   Unfortunately this was not the rental for us and we would have preferred a different area to stay in. "
20699,63460087,2016-02-23,52509388,Ivy,"Frank was a very welcoming and friendly host. When we first arrived, he gave us a map and walked us through highlights of the city. He also had a few restaurant recommendations and they were all very good. He was also very responsive - our hairdryer stopped working one morning and by the time we got home that evening, a new dryer was on our bed!

The room was very clean and spacious, and the private bathroom was nice. It's situated in a convenient location - about a block away from the closest metro, 1 stop from Termini and 15 minutes from the Colosseum by foot. I'd stay with Frank again next time!"
20699,63706331,2016-02-26,28235549,Mandi,"Frank's was awesome. The location was perfect for walking to the main sites and close to the train station. There was also a great indoor market a block away where we got breakfast one morning. 

Frank has lots of recommendations; take them. He was also very helpful pointing things out and explaining everything and answering all of our questions. "
20699,64047800,2016-02-29,51539343,Danielle,Frank was extremely helpful with providing maps and recommendations! The apartment was just as pictured and described. It was extremely clean and only a 15 minute walk from the Colosseum. It's also very close to a metro. I would recommend staying here :)

20699,65487108,2016-03-15,10859766,Beng Chuen Shane,Frank is a warm and friendly host! His accommodation is beautiful and extremely convenient not only to explore Rome but also near the terminal for easy arrival and moving on to your next spot in Italy!
20699,68955541,2016-04-08,13862882,Jack,"Frank was a great host, greeting us at the door from our 10 minute walk from the termini station. He was very helpful; showing us plenty of places to go and eat, the easiest ways to see the main sites and other sites in the local area. 
The suite was pretty, well equipped, clean and had a very comfy bed. It was very handy for the metro, the nearest metro station being less than a 2 minute walk from the door. It is also just a 15 minute walk from the colosseum. 
We had a late flight on the way home and Frank kindly let us leave our bags with him rather than dragging them around Rome. 
We would definitely recommend this as a great base for exploring Rome. 
"
20699,73122038,2016-05-07,1252994,Ydwine,We had a wonderful time in Rome and thoroughly enjoyed staying in this lovely apartment. The atmosphere in this place is just perfect and we slept like babies- the bed is soooo comfortable and big and the apartment tranquil and beautiful. Frank was an amazing host who did everything to make us feel at home and who gave us great tips on where to go and where to eat etc etc. Highly recommended!
20699,74189307,2016-05-13,53233726,Evette,"Our favorite stay in Europe! We loved Frank's house! The room was large and cozy. It had a comfortable bed, a nice bathroom, and a great location! It was also clean. We loved opening the very tall patio doors/windows and listening to the rain! There are lovely plants on the small patio too. There was a metro stop just a block away and only a 10 minute walk from the train station. You can also walk to the colosseum and other sights. Frank was very friendly and helpful and since he is originally from the U.S, easy for us to communicate with. The WiFi worked great and Frank even let us leave our bags in the locked hallway as long as we needed after checkout our last day. We would definitely stay here again."
20699,77752784,2016-06-03,55383370,Elizabeth,"What we experienced with Frank as our host was nothing less than perfect. 
Our accommodation was beautifully presented and very clean good sized room with ensuite. Other rooms do have a kitchenette. 
The small lift in the foyer made it very easy to move luggage to the upper floors.
Location is close to the tram line, Termini Station and many famous archeological attractions. The Colosseum for example is a mere 25 minute walk. A very good gelato store is maybe a 5 minute walk and a particularly good Italian Trattoria about a 10 minute walk. 
The neighbourhood is very safe and not too (Website hidden by Airbnb) worst you may hear a tram rattle by but double glazed windows usually cancel that out!
Frank made himself available for us when we had a problem with our Cashcard ... even to the point of using his own phone. 
Another service Frank provides is a pre-arranged pickup from or to the Airport. A great way to start a holiday having the driver give you tips and lessons in Italian!
Great service all round."
20699,78422928,2016-06-06,24862969,Devon,Frank's place was the perfect spot to spend a few nights while we visited Rome. Walking distance to the Coliseum and other city sights. There are a few neighborhood restaurants close by and grocery store  as well. Frank gave us some great recommendations and helped us enjoy our three days in the city. Air conditioning works great and there is a small balcony that lets a nice breeze in to keep the room cool. The shower is a decent size as well.. something that can be hard to find in Europe :)
20699,79367129,2016-06-12,2585334,Judith,"Frank met us at the apartment which has a lift (thank goodness).  No kitchen but a kettle and little fridge. Bed fine but a little low! The room is near the station and road works were being done when we were there. The area is a little out of the way (and there is graffiti on every building doorway) but after two days of walking finally decided to catch the metro! Which is 2 mins from the apartment. Fantastic! So easy, fast and cheap! Do this from day one! Really enjoyed our stay. Did 6 hour eclectic bike ride around Rome, brilliant. Frank was very helpful and told us the best restaurants - all very close. Make sure you book."

He was truly an amazing host. The property was just as pictured, clean, very close to the metro and train station, and within 5-10 minutes walking distance to many attractions! The area was safe and in an area with multiple stores and restaurants but very quite at night. If you are headed to Rome, make sure to look at Frank's properties, you won't be disappointed! "

Frank met us on time at the apartment and was more then helpful in letting us know about the room and his tips for the area. His guidebook was also really helpful in finding amazing places to eat. Frank was great during our stay - we didn't need him at all except to call us a taxi for our trip to the airport. He arranged this so quickly for us and his supplier was great - we had a little tour on our exit out of Rome! :)

The area is near the Termini Station and the metro is a few min walk which was easy to get to all the spots.
 The room was clean and comfortable but the only problem was WIFI, it only works from a certain spots in the room (not enough coverage near the bed or the corners) so it kept getting disconnected. 
He helped us book an early morning taxi to the airport as well which was helpful.
Overall good experience :)"

He was the best host we had so far, in that he spent the time to welcome us in person, give us a map and mark down great recommendations on where to eat and sight-see.  We were able to check in much earlier than we expected, which opened more of the day to us for exploring.  

The room was in a perfect location for us.  The metro was only a block away which made travelling to all the major parts of the city a breeze.  It was great having a lift especially after long days of walking in the blazing heat.  There were plenty of restaurants and an awesome gelateria within walking distance.  

The room was comfortable and the airconditioning was very welcome during this hot time of year.  The street noise can be loud in the evenings if you have the shutters open but closing them is enough to quiet most of the noise.  

Overall, it was a great place to stay.  We felt very safe and comfortable.  We would definitely stay there again.  "
20699,97360748,2016-08-27,79150002,Corey,Very clean and neat with a nice small balcony. Internet was ok and ac worked.

20699,106402970,2016-10-06,27013981,Catriona,Frank went out of his way to make us feel welcome. His knowledge of the area was great and his tips were extremely helpful. We both hope we can come and stay again soon. 
20699,108876900,2016-10-17,70133421,Kelly,"Such a lovely stay in this great apartment in a perfect location. 2 mins to the metro station, a twenty minute lovely walk to the Colesseum and a great neighbourhood of bars and restaurants. The best part was Frank's welcoming intro to the apartment and the city with fantastic recommendations that really made our trip exceptional. Wouldn't hesitate to book here when returning to Rome, we felt like we had our own little Italian apartment for the weekend! Thanks for a great experience. "

20699,110581090,2016-10-27,44888710,Caleb,"Frank was excellent. He met up with us early on short notice. The room was fantastic and he gave us some excellent recommendations for restaurants and things to do. There's an awesome 100+ year old gelato shop 2 minute walk away, and a gourmet food market about 2 minute walk away. Definitely recommend!"
20699,111095464,2016-10-30,64343676,Sam,"Excellent communications and Frank was very accommodating with regards to arrival time. The room was very spacious and clean, with a good private bathroom. The flat is located within easy walking distance of all Rome's major attractions, making it very convenient for a short weekend break. I would definitely recommend Frank's place to others."

20699,113205548,2016-11-11,12780499,Shallamaine,"Frank was an excellent host with lots of information about what to find nearby. Good location, not far from all there is to see and do in Rome."

Frank was always available and easy to communicate with even arranging a car for me in the early morning. 
will definitely be staying here again for my next journey to rome. :) "
20699,115161617,2016-11-22,96475723,Mark,I had a fantastic time in Rome & I am very grateful to Frank and all his efforts in ensuring my visit as a whole was well-rounded and that I had access to everything I need to enjoy my stay! I loved the recommendations for sites and food as well!
20699,115941873,2016-11-27,32612536,Lauren,"We loved our stay here! It is as cute as the pictures online make it look! Frank was a great and very helpful host. He gave us a ton of information and a map as soon as we got there-we LOVED the recommendations (check out their guidebook)! We visited about 5-6 of the different spots recommended and can't speak highly enough about the restaurants/gelato!:) The street noise can get a little loud maybe for some but hey,its Roma! It is a great location near the termini, colosseum, and the metro-this was our favorite airbnb on our trip!"
20699,123426212,2016-12-29,5431208,Corey,"Frank and Soledad's place is fantastic. The room is exactly as advertised, very comfortable with classic styling. Frank was easy to communicate with, punctual upon my arrival, and had great suggestions on where to eat and explore in the neighborhood. The only minor issue was spotty internet - it was not a problem for me (basic personal tasks), but if you were planning to work from the unit it may not be sufficient. Overall highly recommend. Thank you Frank! "
20699,124913511,2017-01-03,50332890,Derek,"Frank was very patient and explained everything in detail to us personally. The room was fantastic and very clean. There were many great local bakeries and restaurant nearby as well as supermarkets. If you are craving for warm soup during winter, there is a korean restaurant just 10 steps. This really helped me get thru the cold during my stay. "
20699,126363803,2017-01-11,6263157,Bremeline And Paul,We had a great stay at Frank and Soledad's. Frank was super helpful and gave us some great tips/advice on seeing the sites. The room is very bright and location is really handy. It has everything you need. We walked everywhere. Check out Panella's for breakfast! Definitely would stay again. Many thanks :) 
20699,127146561,2017-01-16,23886133,Juliette,"Frank and Soledad's place was very nice ! The room was very clean and cosy ! Moreover Frank gave us all lot of good tips so we enjoyed more.
I definitely recommend this place if you want to stay a few days in Rome.
The localisation is great, the place is just near the trains station et the metro.

20699,128243142,2017-01-23,90272549,Jenilssa,Great stay! The place was beautiful and very clean. Frank was so helpful and accommodating! Highly recommend!!! 
20699,129359711,2017-01-30,14073707,Eddie,"Good stay, clean, comfortable, close to public transport and some great recommendations for restaurants. 
Make sure you have a way to contact the host 10 minutes before getting to the apartment (i.e. internet access or a phone that you can call on), otherwise it can be a little difficult checking in. Only disappointing feature was the wifi in the apartment which was very slow. All in all,  happy with the stay."
20699,132709660,2017-02-19,106733475,Zara,"Beautiful apartment, exactly as seen in photos, we really enjoyed our stay here and Frank's suggestions!"
20699,133714066,2017-02-24,14660964,Tracy,"This was a great stay!  The room was super clean (as in the pictures).  The private balcony was super nice.  Frank was waiting for me on the street for check in, provided a city map, suggestions are in their online guidebook, and he said to contact him for anything else (which I didn't need, but it was nice to know I could).  Prior to booking Frank & Soledad's place, I was hesitant thinking it was a little bit removed from the major sites, but I was wrong...I loved that it was a super quick walk from Termini (drop of my bag) and within walking distance of everywhere I wanted to go in Rome and (Website hidden by Airbnb) I think the location could not have been better.  I would stay here again."
20699,134126927,2017-02-26,69064917,Pedro,"I liked this accommodation and I recommend, because is near of everything."
20699,134802435,2017-03-01,50172809,Sally,"A fantastic choice! Frank & Soledad make everything easy for you. They offered to arrange transportation for our arrival from the airport and Frank met us when we arrived to show us around. He provided a very detailed map and even took the time to mark all the important places to see plus so much more. His map was our tour guide. The apartment is located in a place that makes it easy to get anywhere. If you stay here, get metro passes. You can get anywhere from the metro stop that takes 5 minutes to reach. The room is clean, comfortable and quiet. I highly recommend! "
20699,135239818,2017-03-04,10047218,Wouter,Zeer goed gelegen appartement. In de omgeving leuke restaurantjes weg van het toeristisch centrum.
20699,135951487,2017-03-07,53970135,Ann-Kathrin,"Das Zimmer ist sehr schÃ¶n. Man hat alles was man braucht (eigenes Bad, FÃ¶hn, kleiner Balkon, KÃ¼hlschrank)! Die Unterkunft ist super gelegen, man ist ist in 2 min bei der Metrostation, in 15 min zu Fuss ist man beim colosseum.
Frank ist auch ein netter Gastgeber,der einen gleich die wichtigsten und hilfreichsten Informationen zur Umgebung mitteilt! Er ist sehr zuverlÃ¤ssig und hilfsbereit."

20699,137751754,2017-03-17,31500723,Philip,"Frank was very forthcoming, right after checkin he gave us recommendations regarding sight seeing, restaurants and night life. The apartment was clean and conveniently located in the city centre. At night it is a little bit noisy because of the traffic. After checkout we left our bags at the apartment to picked them up later. We had a good stay at Frank's House!"
20699,139578575,2017-03-26,73979158,Tonya,Our room was wonderful. We really appreciated the independent AC/Heat and the mini fridge. Frank was available night and day and was always ready to lend a hand and show us the best routes to the major sightseeing places. He encouraged us to use the metro and let us know when there was an organized  protest planned so we could avoid the ruckus. Excellent Host!
20699,140889589,2017-04-01,25460760,Miranda,"Kamer okÃ© en goede uitleg van Frank , alleen veel geluidsoverlast ."

20699,142047508,2017-04-06,54501499,Bethan,"Honestly couldn't fault the stay. Truly organised and the apartment is very safe and secure, needing 3 keys to be able to access the room. We stayed in the vintage suite, although Frank does offer other rooms, and the facilities were amazing. The pictures really do match the reality when you get there. The balcony is stunning, the bed is SUPER comfortable and the bathroom is petite but gorgeous. Very very happy with our stay and will recommend it to everyone... thank you!!!!"
20699,142693885,2017-04-09,83577225,Jessica,"Ett jÃ¤ttebra boende. PrisvÃ¤rt! Frank var vÃ¤ldigt trevlig och ordnade med karta och tips till oss. Ett ok omrÃ¥de som vi Ã¤ndÃ¥ gillade, nÃ¤ra till tÃ¥gstationen och vÃ¤ldigt nÃ¤ra till Metro. Vi hittade flera bra restauranger i omrÃ¥det och det fanns mÃ¥nga fler att utforska. "
20699,143583296,2017-04-12,75790258,Andrew,"I had a really bad experience before staying here. My original host never answered as I showed up to the door. Frank happens to be neighbors with who I was supposed to stay with. As I was waiting outside where I was supposed to stay, Frank and I started talking. I explained that I had no place to stay for the night. He kindly last minute opened up his room for the night completely last minute. The place was absolutely perfect. The bed is comfortable, the place was very clean, and very quiet. I literally don't know where I would have slept if it weren't for Frank. Awesome host and a beautiful place. "
20699,143983296,2017-04-14,24679308,Ellen,Large airy bedroom with bathroom near some good restaurants and a GREAT gelato place.  Huge indoor food market but no facilities for food prep - might consider one of the units with a kitchen for a longer stay.  Near lovely piazza and short walk to  Santa Maria Maggiore.

20699,149610476,2017-05-05,3151698,Kayla,"The vintage suite was perfect! Very walkable from termini station, and we felt very safe. Frank gave us great suggestions for delicious drinks and food, and a map to help us get around and navigate the big city. The apartment was just like the pictures and was a great size. We loved the balcony and fresh air. Rome was simply amazing and were very thankful to have found and stayed at Frank and Soledad's property! Grazie!"

20699,152135899,2017-05-15,117344286,Sharon,Loved staying at Frank and Soledad's room.  He arranged a ride from the airport with a lovely gentleman who serenaded us the whole ride. We were met early so we could drop our bags. I greatly appreciated it. The room was spacious and comfortable. Close to the metro and the coliseum is within walking distance. I would definitely recommend and hope to stay here again some day
20699,156595719,2017-05-31,68062167,Elizabeth,Great stay! Frank was very responsive and the place was perfect for a few days in Rome. Would recommend!

20699,157940286,2017-06-05,97693082,Lydia,"Frank & Soledad's place was an absolutely fantastic place to stay for our first visit to Rome! Upon arrival, Frank warmly welcomed us and mapped out all of the places worth going. He also pointed out his guidebook, in which he has many more great restaurants/attractions labeled on the map. We especially loved La Carbonara for dinner, Panella for breakfast, and Palazzo del Freddo for delicious gelato! The room was spacious and clean with a beautiful view off the balcony. The map he labeled helped us navigate the city and discover all of Rome's wonderful attractions. Couldn't have imagined a more perfect trip in a more perfect place!"
20699,160494992,2017-06-14,115657081,Cristel,"This is the place to stay in Rome, good location if you are coming by train and good location for the Coliseum. "

20699,162232200,2017-06-20,35289705,Sara,Verzorgd en fijn verblijf. Centraal gelegen dus dat is fijn als je met de trein reist. Verder vonden wij de buurt niet heel bijzonder. Frank heeft ons goed geholpen en prettige uitleg gegeven! 
20699,164645594,2017-06-28,114089005,Catherine,"Frank and Soledad's place is in a great location! There is so much to see and eat right around this room. Frank also set up transportation from the airport to his place for us and greeted us when we arrived. He then gave us a map and mapped out all of his suggestions of places to see and eat at! I would highly recommend this room to anyone visiting Rome. We hope to come back, as Rome was the highlight of our trip!"
20699,165251579,2017-06-30,53778545,Rachel,Frank was very welcoming and even met us at the door to the apartment so it was super easy to find! The room was exactly like how it was pictured and the bathroom is really nice. Overall a nice place to stay!
20699,165992047,2017-07-02,26371354,Robin,Loved the room and balcony. Very handy for the metro but also very easy to walk to the Colisseum and the Forum. And who can forget the ice cream place round the corner. Yum yum. Frank and Soledad are excellent hosts. Frank is a mine of information about the local area and we are very grateful to him for sorting out taxis to and from the airports which saved lots of precious time.
20699,167241638,2017-07-06,83736079,Ethan,"Wonderful, clean place to stay in Rome!  The only drawback was a little bit of street noise, but besides this I can't imagine a better place to stay for the value.  Frank is very friendly and the room was extremely comfortable.  Short walk to the subway and Termini station which makes Rome pretty accessible.  It's a big city so you'll have to do some walking no matter where you stay.  A/C and internet work great which were really the only 2 amenities we cared about.  I highly recommend it!  "
20699,169019997,2017-07-11,60893891,Swarna,"The flat is in a lively residential neighbourhood close to many wonderful restaurants and cafes - which Frank very helpfully pointed out to us! The gelato place nearby should not be missed. The room itself is very comfortable, spacious and adequately equipped with a beautiful balcony with a view onto the nearby square. Frank was flexible with my arrival timing, accurate and accessible with regards to communication and goes the extra mile in suggesting places to visit and eat at if needed. Definitely would consider this flat if I visit Rome again. "
20699,170039944,2017-07-14,84505693,Emily,"Frank was a great host - very attentive and gave a lot of great advice. Speaks great English (we weren't sure what to expect on our fist trip to Rome). The apartment was comfortable but small and not in the most convenient place for exploring centro storico but had good access to Monti neighborhood which has fun restaurants and bars. Very clean, air conditioning works well, bathroom nice (though limited water pressure). "
20699,172450656,2017-07-21,21830636,Mary,"Great (Website hidden by Airbnb) the colesseum and roman forum.   Within walking distance. Great eateries, the bakery that frank recommended was  amazing. Franks communiation was concise and precise.  Room was spacious and extremely comfortable.  The park near by provided an outdoor movie theatre.  Main train station was conveniently located close by.  Virtually nearly everything was located at our doorstep.  We will definitely be back.  Mary and antonija"

He made us feel welcome right from the moment he said hello. The room itself is gorgeous, clean and luxurious with a really modern en-suite and a beautiful balcony. The room is well equipped with a TV, kettle and mini fridge to provide some home comforts. I'd highly recommend this room or any other of Frank's listings for anyone wanting to stay in Rome. "

We love the gelato place, ""carbonara"" and the bakery that Franks suggests! The apartment is lovely and exactly as described in pictures! Communication was also amazing and Frank let us keep our suitcases in the apartment until 6pm which was amazing and saved us a lot of hassle! We had a lovely time- thank you! The location is very close to public transport however the area did feel a little""seedy"" as is described on (Hidden by Airbnb) when staying close to termini- but this didn't affect our stay! Just a lot of walking at night! Would definitely recommend this apartment! "

20699,183349936,2017-08-17,59766537,David,"This is a comfortable, quiet room within walking distance of all of the sites. Frank was also very helpful with planning our quick overnight stop, which we very much appreciated! A great stay."
20699,184652129,2017-08-20,969402,Alfredo,"Lugar amplio , limpio , cerca de termini, el anfitriÃ³n muy bueno"
20699,186257595,2017-08-24,2548253,Myra,"The room is listed as a ""private room"" but it could easily be listed as  ""own apartment"" because it felt more like a hotel room or a room in a b&b than just a private room in a house. You entered into a wonderfully smelling apartment and went straight to your private room, which had its own bathroom. The room was beautiful, clean, and airy, and the bathroom was great, too. We had consistent internet (though the wifi isn't very strong), were less than a ten minute walk  to the train station, and had easy access to taxis. Frank was also very responsive when we needed help and he gave us great recommendations for how to order taxis and roam the best restaurants in the city. Overall, a fantastic stay in this apartment."
20699,186669351,2017-08-25,27250629,Sophia,"Thank you so much for having us. We had a lovely stay and you were extremely accaomdating. Great responses, suggestions and so helpful. Good location as very easy to get to the terminal train station."
20699,187643788,2017-08-27,437213,Monika,"This was our 2nd stay at Frank's Appartement and it was a perfect decision to book it again - great, individual location, very central and nice contact. I definitively recommend this place "
20699,189234318,2017-09-01,651780,Alexandra,"We could tell frank truly loves hosting his traveling guests; had maps, restaurant recommendations, public transport tips, airport transfer service arranged for us. Room felt airy and bigger than the pictures suggest due to high ceilings and the balcony - very comfortable place to stay for a longer duration of time. Proximity to termini station and larger sites such as the coliseum makes it a no-brainer even for those who may have concerns about it not being a typical tourist area. Great restaurants all within walking distance; good value and quality with very friendly waitstaff. Area always has people milling about so never felt unsafe even when walking back to apartment late at night. Would love to stay here again!"
20699,191869229,2017-09-09,58255023,Kerrianne,"Spotless and chic apartment near the center of Rome. The room is HUGE for Rome, and is a mix of vintage and modern. We loved the mini fridge to store drinks and the cute little balcony. Frank was very helpful with planning our stay and once we arrived, he recommended great restaurants (try to make reservations in advance if you can). Thank you Frank for an awesome stay!!"
20699,194242832,2017-09-16,26384396,Philip,"I stayed here 9/9/2017 -9/17/2017. Frank was so nice and helpful, even checked on me when my flight was delayed an hour. He was patient when I was a little lost finding the place (first time to Rome) and accommodating with places to go. The suite feels like a studio apartment, it is very centrally located just like it was advertised. The street is really busy, so it is not the quietest location. You soon get used to and welcome the noise. Even walking home late at night, always felt safe. Would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Frank!"
20699,195154284,2017-09-18,131284932,Elizabeth,Frank & Soledad's place was exactly how pictured. Extremely clean and perfect for visitors who want a relaxing place to stay after a day of sightseeing. My husband and I were able to walk to all the major landmarks around Rome.  Franks recommendations and map he provided were spot on and we couldn't have asked for anything more! We hope to return soon.
20699,196963732,2017-09-24,35867442,Shirley,Loved the big window with shutters that onto a plant filled balcony. Frank helped us get our bearings in a new city.  Sweet place!

The room was not ready when we arrived at the agreed check in time, and we had to leave our bags while the cleaner came back and cleaned the room. Other then that it was an excellent stay."

I only wish I could have stayed longer!"
20699,210048862,2017-11-07,95287860,Elisshia,This apartment was amazing. Exactly how itâs described. Frank was so helpful when arriving and gave us a map and pointed out things for us. Had an awesome little balcony overlooking the local park to the left. Itâs nice and peaceful inside the apartment. The other guests staying in the other apartments within the apartment were really friendly and were all respectful of noise. Was a tad noisy at night so earplugs are recommended but it is in a city so noise it to be expected. Itâs within good walking distance of everything. Maximum of 25 mins walk or a 5 mins subway journey. Was a great little stop for one night and I couldnât recommend it enough. Thanks so much guys.

And the neighbor has lots of Asian restaurants and supermarkets so for someone like me who has traveled in Italy for 2 months,is a perfect place for grab some different kind of food.

The room itself is big and clean,the internet is fast. The only problem for me is the noice from the street,but after a while you will get used to it. Since here is Rome so is impossible has no sounds from the street. 

Frank is very friendly and he has told me lots of information during the check in and always response the messages very fast. 

I enjoyed my stay in this room after all. 
Thanks for everything."

20699,242180272,2018-03-11,148976168,John-RaphaÃ«l,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay here. The room is a short walk away from the metro and an easy walk to the Colosseum. Frank was extremely helpful with getting us settled in and also gave us some great recommendations. The room itself was clean and stylish, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was nice. Frank also let us leave our bags there after we checked out to wander the city before our flight in the evening. I would really recommend staying here."
20699,243504276,2018-03-16,77232535,Danielle,"Basic room and bathroom, very clean. The apartment felt very safe and had lovely AC and heating.  The noise from the traffic outside at night time is really bad so maybe avoid if you canât sleep through noise. The Collosseum and Palatine Hill are a 15 minute walk away, but a lot of the other sights and the cobbled, quaint areas of Rome to sit and enjoy apperitivo or afternoon lunch are quite far away. The Met station is only a few minutes walk away that will get you to areas quicker, but not ideal if you like to walk around cities. If youâre planning to get the Met everywhere anyway, then it wonât be a problem for you. Frank and Soledad are really lovely hosts, very helpful and friendly and communication is very easy and seamless. 
We were meant to be checked out by 10am, and we had a knock on the door from the cleaner at 9.50  saying that other guests were going to be there at ten so we got our luggage out into the hallway pretty quickly and we met the other guests in the hallway when finishing off our hand luggage packing, and they had to go into our uncleared room which was a little embarrassing. 
All in all an okay stay, stay here for good value and if you donât mind walking a fair bit or getting the Met."

Only drawback was the location- was really close to the train station, but the area seemed somewhat sketch. Didnt feel super safe walking late at night, but felt VERY safe once inside the bnb. Overall a great stay!"
20699,245400758,2018-03-22,174780745,Amy,"An absolute gem of a property! I fell in love with this property from the photos and convinced my friend that sharing a bed wouldn't be so bad as long as we stayed here. Glad she didn't object (too much) because it was totally worth it. The room smelled wonderful, was spotless and as cute as the photos suggested, and it was a convenient and safe walk to the Metro station. The walk to the Colosseum was also easy...just 20 minutes! Frank greeted us at check-in and supplied us with a map and lots of recommendations on sites to see and places to eat. We hit up a few of his restaurant suggestions and were not disappointed! If I'm ever back in Rome, I hope to stay here again!"
20699,249619606,2018-04-02,176139131,Anne,"Frank was so friendly and accommodating. He gave us some great tips for our stay, including a gelato store recommendation that ended up being one of our favorites in Rome! Also, the place looks exactly as pictured!"

It is conveniently located to train and metro transportation making it possible for us to see more and do more while in Rome. Frank's recommendations were extremely helpful. We would absolutely stay here again.
20699,260283048,2018-05-04,50250100,Sami,Frank was a wonderful host! Greeted us downstairs at the door and gave us recommendations for restaurants and things to see/do. He gave us a map and marked it with important must sees. He was so kind to let us leave our luggage there as well for a couple extra nights when we backpacked to Naples. Such a great experience and walking distance to it all. Will stay again if weâre ever in Rome!
20699,260556468,2018-05-04,167413054,Valerie,"Frank est un hÃ´te EXCEPTIONNEL! Nous avions seulement une nuit Ã  Rome et il nous a fait un parcours parfait pour rÃ©ussir Ã  tout visiter dans le dÃ©lai que nous avions. Il est vraiment gentil! Merci encore Ã©normÃ©ment.

20699,262311476,2018-05-08,30669867,Kari,"Frank & Soledadâs flat was ideal for our stay, being within walking distance to Roma Termini. If youâre looking for a cozy place to call home thatâs not surrounded by tourists like some of the other neighborhoods are, look no further! Not to mention, Frankâs hospitality and knowledge of the city is A++. Our only regret was not staying longer. Thanks again for everything!"

The most important thing is that a very famous icecream shop is just 5-minute walk! The guy who received us was a quite nice man. He told us the detailed information about eating and shoping in Rome. And he did us a lot of favor during our trip.

Frank and Soledad arranged an airport pick up for us, which was so appreciated after a long flight. The room was clean, comfortable, and the AC was very strong (Rome is SO hot in the summer!). The location was very close to the Colosseum and also Termini train station. We walked to the Colosseum our first morning in Rome and it was a lovely 10-15 minute walk. There were plenty of places right around us to eat or grab a gelato and we had no trouble finding a place with an open table. We would highly recommend staying here and hope to return ourselves!"

Very stylish clean space as well!

They were communicative and check-in was easy and fast (this is rare in Rome) and the place is gorgeous and clean and Frank, as per usual, introduced me to local gems that were spot on. This is, hands down, the best AirBnB experience I've had in Rome this far. I can't recommend it anymore. Worth the price."
20699,297183057,2018-07-27,3462413,Jeffrey,"Frank, you were an incredible host. Thanks for being so accommodating to our schedule (the train delay made for a much later check-in), and for being extremely helpful with information on where to eat, get great gelato, where to sight-see and walk at night. The guidebook on your AirBnB page worked very well, but even more--we appreciated how you spent a great deal of time and effort in drawing on the map where to go and how to get around. Your guidance made our stay very easy. As for the room, it was very clean, comfortable, cozy, and quiet, and we enjoyed it very much. We felt safe and also appreciated the elevator (all of our other AirBnB's in Italy had no elevators so we had to walk numerous flights of stairs to get our luggage up to the room). The location of the room was also a bonus, being so close to the Roma Termini train station and a couple of minutes' walk from a metro station to get around town. Finally, thank you very much for arranging the early morning taxi pickup to take us to the FCO airport. You made things very easy for us by booking that taxi. We would highly recommend Frank and his AirBnB to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Rome. Thanks, Frank! -Jeff and Darcy :)"

I have never experienced such a great experience.  This one I will never forget.

The room itself is beautiful, high ceilings and stunning balcony. I would 100% recommend staying here, and will do so again if I happen to return. Thanks Frank!"

20699,307466826,2018-08-14,31003026,Shaina,"The location is about 10-15 min walk to the coliseo. The place is spacious and stylish. Frank was responding quick to the messages and arrived to accommodate us as soon as I got to the place. He even spend a little time recommending us restaurants and places we had to visit. 
I would stay here again. "
20699,309377540,2018-08-18,10834497,Natiel,Frank is a great host with great local knowledge and advice. The private room and bathroom was plenty big and nice AC since we were there in August! The street is unfortunately dirty below which leads you to believe where you are staying is too but the apartment we stayed in is very nice and clean! It is easy walking distance to all the sites and great eats. Thanks Frank!
20699,312920660,2018-08-24,180523607,Justin,Weâre very happy with our stay at Frankâs apartment. Andrew was very helpful with our check in and during our stay as well. This apartment was located very conveniently for us to get around the city. It is also clean and thoughtfully styled. We highly recommend this place! 
20699,315298807,2018-08-28,128281684,Joanne,Great access to metro. Andrew was helpful & responsive to all our questions. Good value.
20699,318059603,2018-09-03,76180035,Jun,"Very loud neighborhood in our opinion. The room was super duper cute and clean. There was only a thin flat sheet on the bed, no duvet. I asked the gentleman who was attending the space for the host who was apparently out of town, he said it was not possible to provide a duvet. I had to ask him to double check and he found one in a couple hours of my request. Other than that, it was a small shared apartment with a private room and private bathroom which was fine and clean but in what seemed like a sketchy area. Even the guy substituting for the host gave us a map of places around the building to avoid at night as they were unsafe. Tv wouldnât work which was crappy because one night there was crazy thunder storms and I couldnât sleep and I wouldâve liked to have something to watch instead of laying wide awake in bed as tv noise helps me to sleep, but thatâs a personal preference, probably unimportant to most.  Wouldnât book again given the aforementioned items."
20699,320067296,2018-09-08,89937029,Nicole,"The place is clean and bright, it really made us feel like we were in the real Rome seeing people go buy in there everyday lives.
Easy walk to beautiful cafes, shops and the amazing Colosseum. 
We are quite fit so we walked to all the attractions in Rome and didn't need any public transport to get around.
A map and directions were provided which was so helpful!"
20699,323706842,2018-09-16,19451346,Noelle,Had a nice stay here. The place was very clean. It was nice to have a private bathroom and a little balcony. It was very close to the train station but a bit out of the way to the sites north of the colosseum. The colosseum was about a 15 minute walk.

20699,325622889,2018-09-20,52720267,Yi-Chun,"We had a wonderful experience in staying Frankâs house. Frank is very hospitable and friendly. Great location, clean environment. Itâs the best choice to stay in Rome."
20699,326389840,2018-09-22,208103756,Paul,Central location near train terminal.  Exception food nearby.   Good guidance from the host.
20699,326845093,2018-09-23,37509948,Jacob,"Awesome place, great location. Nicest shower I used in Italy!"
20699,329596553,2018-09-29,200678991,Mary Sue,"Frank and Soledad are wonderful hosts. They arranged a driver to pick us up from airport and bring us back was flawless. The room was centrally located .. very near transportation. The room was what we expected clean and comfortable. The elevator was handy when moving in and out. Frank was helpful in suggesting places to go and eat... from Roma âdelisâ , to trattorias and helped make reservations at a restaurant."
20699,330900168,2018-10-01,170661421,Dan,"Frank was a great host. He welcomed me when I arrived and gave me many tips on where to go during my two day stay in Rome. Also, he was incredibly responsive to my questions over (Hidden by Airbnb) . To top it off, the shower and bed were great at this place. Would stay again!"
20699,331353040,2018-10-02,215466072,é,"Frankâs apartment with elevator is a wonderful place for tourists. Itâs safe clean and bright. Everything we need worked perfectly. In the central of Roma, 2 min walk from metro station and near Roma termini. What is more important! Itâs just beside the best ice cream shop in Roma."
20699,334087320,2018-10-08,2559212,Mary,"Great apartment!  Very secure area, lots of restaurant and shopping options nearby.  Close to the subway. Awesome view from balcony and easy walk to the train station. We tried using the MyTaxi app which only got us a taxi twice. We were able to hail one a few times and had to resort to Uber twice, which is literally twice the price of a taxi. We enjoyed our stay in Rome, the apartment is located fairly close to the Colosseum and Roman Forum. It's a bit of a hike but you can walk back from the Spanish steps(about 30 minutes). Frank and Soledad arranged for a driver to pick us up at the airport - which is an awesome option after a day spent travelling and you don't feel like figuring out the bus or train schedule right away. Although there is a train that runs from the airport to the train station nearby very frequently. Highly recommend!"
20699,334784925,2018-10-10,80579120,Steve,"From the moment we booked, Frank and Soledad worked to make our trip to Rome a great adventure.  Great hospitality.  Quick and accurate communication.  A great space with easy access to all that Rome has to offer.   I highly recommend this place for both the quality of the space and the quality of the hosts."
20699,336985734,2018-10-15,152400571,Jeremy,A must stay place whilst in Rome! Walkable to all the major attractions but also the metro at your doorstep. Frank was extremely insightful and also has a great guidebook via (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. Host was super responsive to all our questions and was kind enough to arrange late check out and swiftly organise our ride to the airport. Highly recommended to all those coming to Rome! Will be back for sure :)

Leider ist die Wohnung durch die NÃ¤he zur StraÃenbahn, die an der nÃ¤chsten Ecke fÃ¤hrt, etwas laut."
20699,341939509,2018-10-28,28300753,Isabella,"La casa di Frank  Ã¨ proprio come nelle foto: pulita, luminosa e accogliente. La zona non Ã¨ centralissima ma, proprio per questo, piÃ¹ silenziosa e tranquilla. Nelle immediate vicinanze ci sono alcuni dei ristoranti piÃ¹ buoni di Roma. Il centro storico si raggiunge con una piacevole passeggiata di 20 minuti tra il Colosseo e i fori romani. La vicina zona di Monti Ã¨ stata una bellissima sorpresa. Grazie Frank e a presto."

It is small, but has a very nice charm to it. It is very clean, and the bed is comfortable! This was easily the best AirBnb we had during our recent trip to Italy. 

We met with Frank during check in, and he provided us with super clear instructions on everything and he gave us a great rundown on the city! He took a map and marked things down and showed us routes we should walk in order to make the most out of our time. It came in very helpful as we only had one full day in Rome. 

We also had a issue where the Hot water didn't work one night and Frank was quick to respond. He lives nearby so he was in the building within a couple minutes and had the Hot water working again. 

I would recommend Frank & Soledad's place to everyone. You won't regret it!"

20699,348819287,2018-11-15,183988899,Jasen,"Franks house was nothing short of perfect. He extremely nice and helpful. When I first checked, he provided me with a map and circled all the âmust seeâ spots in the city to visit and showed me the best way to navigate to them all. House was very clean, comfortable and but most important LOCATION. I was able to walk to the colosseum from the house and also, the metro was right up the block which made getting to the other sites very easy. Theres tons of food spots all around so I never went hungry. Franks spot goes HIGHLY recommend."
20699,349758343,2018-11-18,161822426,Nelly,Frank was very helpful and gave us a lot of tips about museums and places to visit. The room was clean and very cozy and the flat situated in a walking distance to most central landmarks!

The location is excellent, at 10-15 minutes by foot from Termini, 2 minutes from a subway station and bus stops, 15/20 minutes by foot from Colosseum and other central landmarks. In the immediate surroundings there is a park, many shops, and some of the best restaurants/cafes we've experienced in Rome (and we are rather picky). Frank has been always available and ready to help us and gave many good tips. Highly recommended."

20699,420587012,2019-03-07,51977206,Juliette & Conor,Room was actually bigger and nicer than we even expected. No noise from the other guests or the road outside. We didn't get a train or a bus once and even walked to the Vatican which is easily the furthest attraction from the apartment. Frank sat with us when we arrived and gave us some suggestions on the attractions and where to eat and drink.
20699,421909223,2019-03-10,19161528,Celina,Super Wohnung und ein schÃ¶nes Zimmer mit eigenem Bad. Die Lage ist sehr gut und die Restaurant Tipps von Frank waren super. Alles allem eine tolle Reise und eine tolle Unterkunft!

Il conseille de trÃ¨s bons endroits pour se restaurer. La chambre est fonctionnelle et trÃ¨s propre, il ne faut rien de plus pour passer quelques jours Ã  Rome. Elle est bien situÃ©e prÃ©s de la gare, du mÃ©tro et des bus pour ce qui n'aiment pas marcher. Je vous conseille cette location sans problÃ¨me vous ne serez pas dÃ©Ã§u.

20699,430783263,2019-03-31,11755836,Marisa,"Our stay at Frank & Soledad's place was great. Frank's communication was super quick and we found the flat in no time from Termini station. He welcomed us with a detailed run-down of Rome and some great spots to eat and drink - we went to the recommended bakeries for breakfast as well as a really cool bar just round the corner. The room and en-suite were clean and the balcony was lovely too. It was also good having a fridge in the room for our drinks and snacks. The area isn't in the tourist centre of Rome but we were only ever 30-45 minutes max away from all the classic landmarks (Colosseum only 15 mins away) and as we like to walk this wasn't a problem at all, we didn't get the metro once! I would definitely recommend staying at their place (:"

20699,464263560,2019-06-05,252098452,Ben,Franks place was amazing. The room is lovely and itâs only a 10 minute walk from the termini station when you arrive. The metro (Vittorio Emanuele) is a one minute walk around the corner and you can get anywhere from there with termini the next stop. You donât need to get the tram anywhere apart from the Vatican - everywhere else is within walking distance and frank gave us some amazing tips when weâd arrived and took the time to sit down with us to talk us through everything we wanted to see. The air con is great and the room is perfectly quiet when you close the balcony doors. Would definitely recommend and stay here again if we came back to Rome!

20699,469294340,2019-06-14,250876369,Chelsy,The apartment is clean and comfortable. I like the big mirror and the big window. It is surprising that there are low-price breakfast shop and restaurant nearby.

20699,478919397,2019-06-30,10001649,Jo,"The location is very convenient, about 10 mins walk to Roma termini station, and close by another metro station too. Randy who check me in gave me a lot of good local tips and showed me around the house in detail. They also let me keep my luggage at the place after check out which helps a lot."
20699,484595243,2019-07-09,220628009,Amy,"This was my third time visiting Rome and I cannot overemphasize what a rare gem this room truly was! REAL A/C, an elevator to help with hauling luggage, a beautiful terrace filled with succulents, good light, stylish decor, and very safe. One of my friends stayed in a hotel in Rome last July and had jewelry stolen from the roomâs safe. This apartment was so safe and much better than a hotel room. I stayed for 8 days (part work trip), and made good use of the tea kettle to make morning coffee in my Aeropress (the mugs in the room are big enough to work with the AP, fyiâvery wide) and the mini-fridge for snacks (picked up fruit/vegan yogurt/non-dairy milk from the Conad grocery store a few minutes away). The neighborhood reminded me a lot of where I live in NYC so it was quiet for me, but perhaps loud for someone coming from a small town, so bring ear plugs and youâll be fine. There are a lot of local cafes, pizza places, and an outdoor bar right by the park where you can get a delicious spritz in the evenings. Close to the Metro, but I honestly just walked to the Colosseo/Forum/Trastevere, because, again, Iâm a New Yorker who walks everywhere. Will stay here again and highly recommend this room to anyone looking for a chill, clean, beautiful, safe accommodation in Rome!"

He spent time with us giving us tips and places to eat, visit, what route we should take, etc. The space was also so much better than we expected, it is a completely private room and bathroom, very separated by one porch that the other guest share. Really could not ask for more, would recommend to anyone and would certainly stay here again :)"

20699,558010478,2019-11-02,67072127,Jack,"This was our second stay with Frank & Soledad. Our a trip was 6 years earlier.  Frank & Soledad are excellent hosts. On each of our trips one of them would take a map of Rome and mark places of interest and make recommendations.  They also made recommendations on local place to eat and to get gelato. 

We love the location. It is a 10 to 15 minutes walk from the Termini. It is also an easy 15 minute walk to the Colosseum and Forum.  There is a subway (Metro) station a block away and the best gelato we found in Italy is only two blocks away. 

The room was very spacious and the bathroom was modern and very nice.  We enjoyed opening the door or shutters to the small balcony. 

We would definitely stay there again."

She spent a lot of time giving us an overview of the places to see in Rome along with many recommendations on where to eat and drink, marking them on the map for us. The room is around a 10 minute walk from Termini station and around 10 minute walk to the Colliseum. You also have a Metro station even closer so it's in a great location. The room is stylishly decorated and very clean and has everything you need. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone spending time in Rome"

Her warm hospitality and delicious breakfasts were not just charming but so unexpected to get such a wonderful wake up each morning.  She assisted us in advise about how to get places and recommendations on restaurants.  The B&B was clean, organized and very good location for travelers coming from train or airport.  Marianna also went out of her way to let us keep our bags there due to a late train departure. We give her ***** (5) stars! "

I would definitely stay here again!"
21193,4447835,2013-05-06,5425325,Gerhard,"Unser erster 4tÃ¤giger Romaufenthalt war ein auÃerordentliches schÃ¶nes Erlebnis. Bei Marianna und ihrer Schwester haben wir uns sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt. Die Unterkunft ist sauber, das FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck kann man selbst zusammenstellen und wird auf der Terasse genossen. Die Gastgeberin ist ausgesprochen nett und beantwortet gerne die vielen Fragen eines Gastes, der sich zum ersten Mal in Rom aufhÃ¤lt. Die nÃ¤chste Metrostation ist zu FuÃ in 5, der Vatikan in 15 Minuten erreichbar, somit beste und schnelle Verbindungen zu den unzÃ¤hligen SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten. Absolut zu empfehlen ist der sogenannte Roma-Pass um Euro 34, mit dem alle Ã¶ffentlichen Vekehrsmittel benutzt werden kÃ¶nnen, die ersten beiden Eintritte in Museen frei sind und viele weitere ErmÃ¤Ãigungen geboten werden. Den grÃ¶Ãen Vorteil des Roma-Passes haben wir darin gesehen, die unendlich langen Schlangen beim Anstehen im Vatikanmuseeum und im Colosseum mit bevorzugtem Eintritt zu umgehen.

Marianna also arranged our transportation, to and from FCO Airport, which was appreciated as we were new to Italy and allowed us check-in late on our arrival.  Also, they provided us with the direction on the places of our interests.  Overall, it was nice and pleasant experience on our first ever stay at an Air BNB lodging. Thanks Marianna and Jusi (hope i got your name correctly spelt). Hope to stay at your place again on our next visit to Rome. Ciao."
21193,441855247,2019-04-22,141679459,Grace,"Marianna was a lovely host and definitely made our stay - she was very polite and helpful in our late check in as well as providing directions and a lovely breakfast! The room was private and a good space, but we were hoping for more of a private washroom as we were caught waiting for other guests."
21193,462511466,2019-06-02,222609762,Victoria,We had a wonderful stay here. The breakfasts were delicious and served with wonderful hospitality. The location was close to the attractions of Rome but the area of the bnb is great to get a genuine experience of what itâs like to be a local in Rome and not just a tourist!
21193,469810697,2019-06-15,42820914,Christian,"Super sauber, verkehrsgÃ¼nstig gelegen, gerne wieder!"
21193,492118691,2019-07-21,31021112,SÃ©bastien,Lovely place with a large choice for breakfast. We had a great stay. Recommended.

Nous avons passÃ© un agrÃ©able sÃ©jour. Chambre situÃ©e proche du mÃ©tro, ce qui permet de se dÃ©placer trÃ¨s facilement dans Rome.
Petit bÃ©mol sur l'insonorisation de la chambre. Hormis cela, nous reviendrons sans hÃ©siter !
Grazie !!"
21193,533129337,2019-09-21,60143436,Alexei,The best BnB where we stayed.
21193,545324857,2019-10-12,36256285,Stefan,"Very friendly and helpful host..
The place was very clean and the breakfast unexpected diverse.
Loved to stay there."
21193,563226348,2019-11-12,306920241,Evelyn,Highly recommend this place! Felt very welcome and safe. The breakfast was always delicious!
21249,47712,2010-05-30,75040,Steve,"We spent a week in this beautifully styled and spacious room with marble floors. The bathroom, situated in the hallway just outside the room, is very modern and clean. You're only a few meters from the Metro that takes you to central Rome and all the sights in 15 minutes. The 'Porta Furba' area itself has nice restaurants, cafÃ©s, a supermarket etc. 

Emanuele is a friendly host, who gave us easy to follow directions from the airport, and then met us at the metro when we arrived. Since the B&B is located on a busy street, sensitive sleepers might want to bring earplugs to block out the traffic sound. "
21249,551745,2011-09-20,1116975,Gert,"We had a wonderful stay at Emanuele's place! The B&B is exactly how it is described on the website: it is clean, spacious and has a very comfortable bed. Emanuele is very kind and helpful. He and his misses gave us a warm welcome and made sure we had everything we needed. 
The B&B is located at 100 metres of the metro station which makes it very easy to travel around. I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Rome!"
21249,1115407,2012-04-12,1917095,Dani,"My whole family, including wife, sons, my brothers, parents, nephewsâ¦ spend a few days in Emanueleâs B&B and it was a great experience! The rooms were enormous, as the bathrooms, and everything was clean and comfortable. Itâs really 10 minutes from everywhere and itâs placed in an authentic normal roman neighborhoodâ¦ I recommend it to those who donât want to spend too much money for a luxury room in downtownâ¦ better if you save this money for paying an excellent dinner in a fashionable restaurant!!!"
21249,1221387,2012-05-03,1231407,Iris,"Realmente um otimo lugar para se ficar!!!!Sou uma pessoa que viajo muito e tenho o costume de ver diversos tipos de hoteis e alojamentos,mas este foi uma boa surpresa!LocalizaÃ§Ã£o Ã³tima (do lado do metro,e com este Ã© possÃ­vel chegar aos principais pontos turisticos),bairro tranquilo(atÃ© de noite).Quartos limpos(inclusive lenÃ§Ãµes e toalha),o banheiro certamente terÃ¡ que ser dividido com outro quarto,mas para quem vai em familia grande ou grupo de amigos Ã© perfeirto!!maravilhosa recepcÃ£o de Emanule,este em especial muito simpÃ¡tico e prestativo,para tudo que precisamos ele esteve disposto a ajudar!!Ficamos em 6 pessoas,tres quartos,bem grandes e confortaveis!Se ouver algum comentÃ¡rio reclamando de algo....sinceramente ,digo, que esta pessoa procura um hotel,entÃ£o...lembro que isto Ã© um hostel!
Sou muito grata pela cordialidade de Emanuele,que nos ajudou em coisas que nem deveria,como por exemplo arrumar uma van para irmos para o aeroporto,que foi uma grande ajuda,obrigada Emanuele.
Recomendo os quartos limpos e bem cuidados de Emanuel!!!!"
21249,1279342,2012-05-14,1758982,Dragana,"We spent an extraordinary 10 days in Rome and we fully enjoyed our
stay at Emanuele.  The location of the B&B is excellent! Just couple
of meters from metro A, that will take you wherever you want. Plus, the
area of Via Tuscolana is great, very lively with lot of shops, bars
and ice-cream places :) If you are lazy to go to eat in the center,
there is a bar-restaurant at the corner just next to the B&B that is pretty good, always full and with great atmosphere. The food was tasty, and the deserts were excellent! :)
The B&B itself is very nice, clean and spacious, and pretty stylish. The bathroom is huge and very clean. Emanuele is very kind and always available for whatever you need. We will definitely come again!"
21249,1315935,2012-05-21,2009503,Sasa Ratna,"Definitely recommend this guy as a host. he was friendly, helpful and has warm personality. the rooms are very comfy and all 9 of us enjoyed our 3 nights stay very much at Emmanuele's BnB. Thanks for your hospitality Emmanuele :D"
21249,1481663,2012-06-14,2132711,Yuri,"Everything as advertised, including a very hospitable host :-). The B&B is a minute walk from the metro (the Ananigna direction), just what we wanted, an easy connection to the Ciampino airport. Thanks, Emmanuele!"
21249,1524793,2012-06-20,2477247,Neil,"subways areadream in Roma. We could have been in the heart of Rome as Emanuel is correct in saying ( only 30 metre from Subway )
Room and bathroom were not only modern but  a pleasure to stay in.Supermarket only accross the road. 
A good tip: buy a RomaPass and save on bus and rail Travel + 2 free entries into museum."
21249,1550026,2012-06-24,2514019,Juan,"I had good time in Rome, Emanuele is a fantastic host. The accommodation is great, only 20mts away from metro station and 10 min from everything. The place is nice, calm and clean.
Unfortunately, when i was in Rome, There was a strike in the metro and i believe there are no buses to go to the hostel so I took a taxi and it cost me 45euro from city centre.
 "
21249,1603061,2012-07-01,1538296,Carina,The stay at B&B830 was my first experience with airbnb and I have to say that it made me fall in love with the concept. Emanuele was an excellent host. He picked us up from the metro station and travelled a good 30 mins just to get the city maps for us. Not to mention the complimentary yogurts and soft drinks that he bought back. Generally value for money and I will definitely recommend his place!
21249,1885097,2012-08-04,2209583,Jakub,"We spent 4 nights in Rome. Location of the apartment is perfect - few steps to metro station and then 15-20 minutes to the city center. Even with small kids it is very convenient. Room and bathroom were spotless clean. The host is very communicative and helpful - you can contact him during your stay with any kind of problems you may have. Unfortunately the WiFi was broken during our stay but Emanuele offered us his netbook so we were able to check emails and weather :)
However we have two comments: 1. Our room was located on the first floor and it was facing a very busy street. It was impossible to open the windows at night because of the noise. Sleeping with AC on is not very convenient for us but others may find it OK. 2. 'Free parking on premise' does not mean you have a free parking place ready and waiting for you. We were informed by Emanuele that it means that you can leave your car on the street and there is no parking fee in the area... In Rome, finding a parking spot may cost you a lot of time and stress. Fortunately we had luck and found a place in 10 minutes (the host offered us his help if we had problems). "
21249,2205870,2012-09-05,1852882,Araya,"My husband and I were pleased to know Emmanuelle, a lovely host. His place has great location, very convenient to catch the metro and go to central Rome. It perhaps suits young travellers who don't mind the noise of the city ;) "
21249,2256822,2012-09-10,3443351,Cyril,"Emanuele is very pleasant, he picked us at the metro, down his apartment, and his Bed&Breakfast is well organized, spacious and clean. 
The area is ok, although it's not so central and a bit noisy because of the cars, but  the subway is less than a minute from the flat and is very practical (on the line A, going to the center, to vatican and to most of the famous sites)"
21249,2374139,2012-09-22,3181577,Chianti,B&B 830 was clean and roomy with complimentary refreshments and breakfast.  The Metro is right there!  So it made getting around effective and cheap.  Highly recommended.
21249,2486748,2012-10-02,3405147,Sonia,"It was a great experience staying at B&B 830! The place is absolutely spotless, GREAT location, and Emanuele had the kindness to wait for us for more than four hours after our original arrival  (our luggage didn't arrive with us). We sincerely recommend travelers to Rome to stay in B&B 830. If we ever go back to Rome, I surely will look for to with Emanuele. iSaludos desde El Salvador, AmÃ©rica Central!"
21249,3254375,2013-01-03,1745324,Aikaterini,"We spent 5 nights in Rome. Our room was very clean, spacious and nice. The metro is indeed very close and that makes commuting really easy, especially since the location of the apartment is a little bit off center. On the minus side, we were not pleased that we had to pay extra because of the holiday season, since that was not mentioned explicitly in the listing - but we did agree to the new price. Overall it was a very nice experience, Emanuele was very accommodating and a great host. We would recommend this place!"
21249,4208233,2013-04-18,5058354,Blake,"Emanuele gave us great directions to the Airbnb both by metro/bus and taxi.

The Pros:
+Close to the metro to get downtown, the ride is about 10 minutes. 
+The room is very large.
+Your own bathroom, though it is across the hall.
+Warm water and didn't seem to go cold.

The Cons:
-There was a problem with the window shutter, got stuck, had to stick my hands up in the contraption to unstick it. Also the balcony was locked so you cant get out to look around in the morning.  
-Very loud at night, the walls are super thin. So you can hear the traffic and other people in the hostal. Wasn't a huge deal for us but those who can't sleep because of this just a heads up.
-Internet needs to be reset quite often its more of a wireless hotspot than wifi. But worked well when on. :)
-The room doesnt get cleaned while you are there, and only one towel per stay. 

This is more of a fancy hostal than an Airbnb. Donuts, tea, coffee, milk, juice, was left for us in our room. The coffee was pretty quality for instant though (you have hot water in your room). Dont plan on sitting down. 

Something to remember its a place to rest your head, when in Rome you are walking all day. This was a perfect place for us to stay. I would recommend it I just thought a fair review was in order. 

Cheers!

Have a great time in this lovely city and try an affagato (ice cream and espresso!)

21249,4302921,2013-04-26,3838565,Alex,"Emanuelle's B & B was great! Literally right next to a bus line and so easy to get to the main attractions in Rome. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Emanuelle's and would recommend it! Grocery store across the street and great restaurants near by. Definitely out of the hustle and bustle of Rome's City Center, but we loved it!"
21249,4636621,2013-05-17,5795612,Christine,"This place was awesome. Easy to get to from the airport. Great restaurant close by, as well as bakery, grocery store, and post office.  Lots of room, very clean and large. Only 10 minute walk from the metro, which takes you everywhere in a short time. We loved our stay, and Emmanuel was very nice and helpful with any questions we had. If you are looking for a place to stay in rome, this is a great choice."
21249,4836029,2013-05-28,5912847,Michael,There is a great grocery store across the street to buy fresh food  throughout the day and the metro is also very close. Emmanuel was very friendly and helpful. 
21249,4890515,2013-05-31,6041868,Allison,Emanuele was such a great host in Rome!  The room was very clean and the location is right near the Metro which gets you to any sight you would want to see.  The check-in process was very easy and Emanuele gave us great directions from the train station.  I would recommend Emanuele to anyone looking to have a great experience in Rome! 
21249,4930287,2013-06-02,4293614,Adam,"Our stay at B&B was very nice. Emanuele was nice enough to met us at the metro stop which was great because we had no idea where we were going (and had no local SIM cards to check online). 

The B&B itself is super quiet cosy & safe (about three doors with different keys to get in) so no need to worry about security here!

Emanuele even left us some tea, coffee, yoghurt, and croissants which was great because we were starving by the time we got to Rome!

This place is good value especially if you're on a tight budget and don't mind sharing a bathroom with another couple of guests. 

Cheers Emanuele. 
"
21249,5241656,2013-06-20,438060,Daisy,"We stayed at this B&B for the first part of our European trip and having concluded the trip I can say that this was one of the best places we stayed at. Emanuele met us promptly and communication was good, the rooms were clean and most thankfully had AC. It was amazing to arrive from a long day of sight-seeing to a cool room with plenty of space. We had two rooms and our own bathroom and unlike other places we stayed at we had towels for everybody and a never ending supply of toilet paper. 

This place is really close to the metro and a good spot to investigate the city from. Having said that, This is only true if you don't mind hopping on the metro to go into the city. If you you're one of those people that wants to walk from your hotel to the Colosseum, then this is not the place for you. I would highly recommend this B&B, it's clean and spacious; a good place from which to see Rome. "
21249,5458695,2013-07-01,6457051,Maricilda,"Boa localizaÃ§Ã£o,muito prÃ³ximo ao terminal tÃ©rmini,boas instalaÃ§Ãµes e confortÃ¡vel!"
21249,5985119,2013-07-25,6513336,Elaine,"Emanuele and his aunt Anna Maria were a great team taking care of BÂ£B 830. Though injured, Emanuele took care of everything via text messages, extremely reliable. Anna Maria was so sweet! We had a great stay and got to know metro A line very well! The location of this apartment is great. If you visit, make sure you make a stop at the San Giovanni subway stop and visit the gelato place across the street. It's our favourite

Thanks Emanuele e Anna Maria!"
21249,6133538,2013-07-31,7236276,AdÃ¡n,"It is a good place to stay, really comfortable, it has a metro line close by, the metro can take you to most of the attractions."
21249,7149414,2013-09-08,2938844,Robin,"It's very convenient as I'm always in touch with Emanuele in (Hidden by Airbnb) when I was in Paris - Rome. Took the airport shuttle to Termini Station and from there to the B&B located at Porta Furba within (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) mins. It's easy to get connected to all the interesting places in Rome. We took 3 rooms and 1 room was used by other guest in the private apartment.
My review as below:
1. So near to the metro station - Porta Furba
2. Opposite a convenient stall
3. Clean toilet and strong shower.
4. Fast internet connection - can use the free wifi provided by the operator or the building. 
5. New installed air-con so it's pretty confortable during the hot weather after a long day walk. 
6. Cheap and affordable for a comfortable lisenced B&B in Rome.
7. Operator provided coffee & tea facilities, bakeries and milk as well as some fresh juices. 

If you can't accept the 3 bedroom facing the road due to some motorist noises due to your sensative hearing then request for the room facing the back. If you need a housekeeping and daily changes of bedsheets and towels then book the expensive ones in Rome otherwise I would recommend you to explore room staying at this place as I have went through so many choices but I decided to stay here due to Emanuele's efficient reply and warm hospitality! Hope to stay there again if I were to travel to Rome.

21249,7338685,2013-09-16,4836380,Jerrica,"Emanuele was extremely punctual, the B&B was very close to the subway stop, the room was comfortable and clean and I felt very safe. The breakfast was suitable for me but some people may require more. I though it was great and will definitely stay again if I return to Rome."
21249,7447479,2013-09-20,6979270,Carly,"Staying at Emanuele's was fantastic! The room was huge and included everything we needed.

Emanuele is a great host: he met us at the metro station (which is literally 2 minutes from the apartment), he gave us a map and helpful tips on where to go, how to get there, etc, he was very warm and welcoming. The room was set up so that you could have breakfast there in the morning if you chose to (tea, coffee, mini refrigerator with milk, plenty of pastries). "

21249,15186384,2014-07-04,6694082,Virginia,"I stayed at B&B 830 during five nights with friends. The rooms are equipped with everything you need, are clean and comfortable. The B&B is not in the city center, but right next to the metro station, which is very convenient during the day. The metro stops working quite early at night and taxi is the only option (night busses are not very reliable). For breakfast I suggest to go at a bakery one or two blocks down the street and to try pizza at mangianapoli just a couple of minutes on foot from there. 

Conclusion: I suggest this B&B !"
21249,15845533,2014-07-16,17728546,Marek,"I stayed with my family at B&B 830 for two nights. Room was prepared and clean. It was perfect.

Thank you!"

21249,21681577,2014-10-21,22099640,CLaudine,"Getting to Emanuele place was very easy from the Termini train station to his metro stop. He met us at his stop and led us to his place right across the street. Having the metro station right there was very convenient for us. 
He immediately showed us on the map, places and sites to see, and areas to stay away from. To visit all the main sites it takes about 20 minutes from his place.
The room was clean and comfortable with Air conditioner. He had some carton of milk in the fridge for us, which was good because we bought some cereal at the market for breakfast. ( The market is just across the street.)
Emanuele is a nice and friendly host, and made our stay there comfortable.

21249,32130838,2015-05-14,31749599,Arend Willem,"De verhuurder had alles prima geregeld. Van koffie tot ontbijt, het was er allemaal, uiteraard wel op de manier zoals men dat in ItaliÃ« gewend is. Voor Nederlandse begrippen lijkt dat eenvoudig, maar dat weet je als je naar ItaliÃ« gaat. 
De B&B lag toch wat verder van het centrum dan wat we hadden gedacht. Met de metro was het echter allemaal wel te doen, je bent dan redelijk snel over. 
De buurt waarin de B&B lag, liep niet over van activiteiten. Er waren slechts een paar kleine restaurants en een burtsuper. "
21249,32899654,2015-05-23,8594543,Ainslie,"I arrived a little bit later than the time I gave Emanuele but he waited patiently for us and was very understanding when we arrived. We had two rooms in the B&B but none of them looked exactly like any of the posted photos. The rooms and bathroom were clean and the AC worked well. The location is very convenient to the metro but I feel like we were more than 10 minutes away from everything. The neighborhood is pretty quiet. I didnât go out or come in late at night but it seemed like a safe area. We arrived on a Sunday and since itâs not in a tourist area there were very few places open so dinner options were limited. Emanuele was very responsive and helpful throughout the entire stay. My biggest complaint is that the towels were old and very rough. Breakfast was very minimal, just some packaged pastries and tea or coffee. Besides the towels and breakfast everything else was decent. The category this property shows up under is a little misleading though because you do not have access to the entire home/apt, only your room(s) and the bathroom. Overall it was a decent place to stay."

21249,36628557,2015-06-29,33996809,Shannon,"Nice place,exactly what we needed. We were in and out and really only there when we were sleeping. It was perfect right beside the metro stop and very easy to get around. Room was large and beds comfortable. "
21249,37461085,2015-07-07,32073656,Alizeh,"Emanuele's place was located in a nice, very local location. Metro station, market, and restaurants all close by and within walking distance. Sleeps comfortably, rooms are spacious. He provided us with breakfast, coffee, and tea. Emaneule was a great host! Very helpful! I would definitely recommend staying at his place. The only drawback was the smell of cigarette smoke coming from the building. "

21249,51707668,2015-10-24,28650293,Renata,"This B & B should be better described. I understand that if is offered breakfast and throughout the apartment including the kitchen is closed to the guest, the host is doing the cleaning. At this B & B is the guest who does the cleaning and wash your dishes in the bathroom sink. You have to buy the sponge and soap and if you need plates, cutlery, napkins, cloth to wipe any dirt, I mean, anything you need, you should buy because the host provide you a mug and a spoon. I always stay in B & B, including in Rome was not my first time and I had never stayed in a place like that. If you are prepared for it, stay here because the location is close to the underground and make your life easier to go around Rome by subway."
21249,72210853,2016-05-01,17346810,Ari,"First of all, the place is better described as a private room instead of as entire home. You get access to your room and toilet. 
The location is great. The room and bathroom and bathroom are spacious and clean. The host is very nice and responsive"

21249,74710121,2016-05-16,68195562,Miyoung,"Location is very near with metro station, and Host is very good person.
But, 
When I arrived here he required Rome Municipality tax 21 Euros even another BnB Host did not required tax, so I was confused.
And my family(including 1year old baby) took a shower in cold water, cause that time hot water was not available.
Last, the room was so cold cause radiator was not working.

So I hope,
BnB must inform about city tax clearly.
Host must inform about room condition exactly.

21249,75930631,2016-05-23,21845416,Pantea,Emanuele was a really nice host. He picked us up at the station near the apartment and showed us our rooms. He also gave us a Rome map and talked me through it and explained me the map very well. The apartment was tidy and clean. We had an awesome time in Rome! 
21249,76623207,2016-05-28,56877591,Dana,Emanuele made our stay at the bed and breakfast very comfortable. The place is very accessible and is a 15 min metro ride away from the Termini Station and the metro station is right outside. Communication with him was also very smooth.

21249,86596984,2016-07-17,78302914,Liu,"The place is not so close to the city center but luckily very closed to the metro station Porta Furba which is 9 stops from the Termini. Emanuele welcomed us at the metro and guided us to room. The room is nice and clean as described. The neighborhood is convenient with restaurants and supermarket.  
One thing made us confused was that we were informed that we had to pay 3.5 euro per person per night for tourist accommodation tax when we arrive. Its ok but I do hope such information should be written in the description. 
One more thing to note is the acoustics. People talking in the room can be heard clearly in the corridor. "

Thank you. "
21249,105275454,2016-10-01,20355052,Turgut,Place is spacious. It feels more like dormitory. 20minutes from popular spanish steps and 40minutes from Vatican city by public transport. Emanuelle was helpful. He will ask for tax for your stay. It was 21 euros for 2 of us for 3 nights although we forgot to leave the money in the room. This was not provided in the description but he said it's required by the city of Rome. 
21249,106139132,2016-10-04,41657203,Ernesto,"La estancia en el apartamento de Emanuele fue muy buena, fue muy atento y comunicativo para nuestra llegada. La habitaciÃ³n estaba muy bien, espaciosa, cÃ³moda y limpia aunque un poco menos luminosa y nueva de lo que aparenta en las fotos. El baÃ±o privado se encontraba fuera de la habitaciÃ³n pero eso tampoco supone mucho problema... El apartamento estÃ¡ muy bien localizado, con el metro a 2 min(10 min del centro de Roma en metro) con un supermercado enfrente y una pizzeria espectacular a pocas calles (L'ofreddo).
En general fue una experiencia muy buena, si volviera a roma no dudarÃ­a en repetir alojamiento."
21249,111855412,2016-11-02,98833132,Daniel,Emanuele's place was wonderful and welcoming. Emanuele provided breakfast and directions to various places. I recommend this for anyone visiting Rome. 
21249,124602341,2017-01-02,6694638,Maria,"Emanuele was a very friendly host.  He was very flexible with the arriving times and he always answered quickly to my questions. The room was very close to the metro station, so it was easy to reach the most things quite quickly, even if the room is a little bit away from the citycenter. There is a tax we had to pay, 3.50â¬ per night per person in addition. There is a breakfast offered. Instand Coffee and in plastic packed bread etc. We prefered to go to other places to eat.  The room and the batnroom were very clean like on the fotos. The room was ok for us, the only thing we really had problems was the niose.  The room is next to a big street,where the trucks drive very early in the morning. So we had real problems to sleep. For people who are not sensitve on noise, it shouldn't be a problem. "

La habitaciÃ³n y el baÃ±o (que es compartido) estaban limpios. Sin embargo, echamos de menos gel y champÃº en la ducha (que en la descripciÃ³n pone que dispone); y el desayuno para los cuatro dÃ­as que estuvimos lo puso sin leche, y al no tener cocina apenas se puede calentar o preparar nada. Lo mejor la ubicaciÃ³n y limpieza, lo peor el servicio que ofertaba que en parte no se correspondÃ­a con lo descrito.

21249,148248894,2017-04-30,126542576,Rhys,15 minutes into the main tourist areas via metro. Supermarket over the road. Nice little pizzeria close by also! Room was clean! Thanks!
21249,153198387,2017-05-20,79714774,Silvia,"Il B&B Ã¨ situato in un punto abbastanza strategico: nell'isolato accanto si trova la fermata della metro A (porta furba, 15 minuti dal centro) dall'altro lato della strada un supermercato aperto 24h su 24, mentre proprio sotto casa sono presenti un pub Ã¨ una farmacia, quindi per qualunque evenienza la posizione Ã¨ molto comoda. 
La camera in cui abbiamo alloggiato era veramente pulita, e il bagno ampio e altrettanto pulito. Sono forniti asciugamani, lenzuola, un piccolo phon e un frigo bar. La colazione non Ã¨ esattamente una vera e propria colazione con latte e brioches freschi, ma Ã¨ presente una macchinetta per fare il tÃ¨ e delle merendine. Complessivamente ci siamo trovati molto bene, l'host Emanuele Ã¨ disponibile e non invadente. Da tornarci!"
21249,155995237,2017-05-29,130057169,Swarnali,"Me & my husband were in Rome for 4 days and enjoyed living at Emanuele's (Website hidden by Airbnb) below are Pros & Cons

Pros - 1.Place is very close to metro Puerto Farba which is line A and gets you to termini very soon in around 15-20 mins and also vatican which is around 30 mins from the time you step out of door. 2. There is a supermarket opposite to home - so if you want wine/food you know where to go and on top of that is is 24 hours. 3.Room is a nice size and very clean. 4.Emanuele is a wonderful host, we were flying from Paris to Rome and reached very late at around 1:30 am at Emanuele's place and he waited for us to get us checked in, even this late and that is very kind of him.

Cons - 1.Noise at night is immensely loud which was not only disturbing for me as a light sleeper but also for my husband who is actually a sound (Website hidden by Airbnb) this is something that bothered me a lot.  2. Since this is a sharing apartment , you share the bathroom with other people at the apartment however your bedroom is just for you .3. There is no iron/washing maching at this AirBnb .

However summing up pros and cons I will still rate Emanuele as very professional and his apartment very clean and near to many Roman attractions."
21249,158398733,2017-06-06,100838854,Sirjana,"Emanuele was a very friendly host.  The place is close to a metro station. 

My only concern is the description which states this as an entire place which I assumed to be a single flat or similar. This is however a private room with private bathroom and you share the floor with another room and bathroom so I wont really call it a separate house or flat. This is imp because sometimes your safety depends on the other guests too i.e whether they lock the main door properly or not etc.  Otherwise everything was great and I have no issues. "

We got in late because our flight was delayed and Emanuele made sure everything was ready when we got there. Over all it was a good place to sleep and get around.
21249,167981126,2017-07-08,119150280,Seok,Good place to stay for a night not for 3  nights like we did. But overall a good place

La stanza, graziosamente arredata, presenta tutto il necessario per una perfetta permanenza. La zona Ã¨ un po' rumorosa, ma dopo intere giornate fuori, la stanchezza ti fa dormire tranquillamente nel comodo letto. Il punto Ã¨ strategico, in quanto vicino ad un supermercato aperto 24/24 ore e la presenza dell'accesso immediato alla metro A. Essa permette di raggiungere facilmente il centro in pochi minuti. Che dire? Consiglio vivamente questo alloggio, ci tornerei volentieri."

The cleanliness was poor,  lightning was depressing. Also since the apartment is old, the noise at night is unimaginably loud! The atmosphere and overall experience were not worth. Moreover, the B&B logic is very different here. You just get packed cakes and croissants when you check in and you have no other food till you leave."

Check-in was very easy and the apartment was right next to the metro station which was very convenient, a bit far from main attractions but not bad. My only comment would be that I found this to be misrepresented as an Entire Apartment when in fact it is a private room. I was very disappointed because I always filter my Airbnb's to show entire places but this was not. The bathroom is outside the room and it is really just a room, not a full place (ex. No kitchen, the mini fridge that was provided didn't work). You can run into people when you are going to the bathroom or going to shower which could cause inconveniences."

C'est vraiment un logement / dortoir : peu sympathique pour y rester diner ou se poser. Mais idÃ©al lorsqu'on a des journÃ©es bien remplies et lorsque nous avons seulement besoin d'un lit et d'une douche !
3 lits doubles disponibles. 1 seule vraie chambre (avec 2 lits doubles) l'autre lit double est situÃ© dans l'entrÃ©e/salon de l'appartement et ouvert sur la cuisine.
Si vous souhaitez passer plus de temps dans l'appartement, il n'est pas idÃ©al (sombre et bruyant avec les autres appartements de la cage d'escalier). "

22335,73543520,2016-05-08,49484756,Roy,apartment is centrally located and gives easy access to downtown and vatican city. Is also close to the River. Place is spacious and staying at an old building makes for a different experience in Rome. We were met and greeted at the apartment and shown the place around. Great place to walk around Rome.
22335,76346550,2016-05-26,33223249,Sarath Kumar,Die Beschreibung war genau und leicht die Adresse gefunden. Er war hilfreich und freundlich.
22335,84240389,2016-07-06,73391018,Jessica,"Elena was very easy to communicate with. She was was flexible and responsive. We were a couple of four, two of us were delayed but Elena was able to let the other couple in w/o any difficulty-very accommodating. Great location, can walk to all desired places. 10 min walk to Vatican and pantheon; 15 min walk to Trevi, 25 min walk to colosseum. Apartment was spacious. Three couples could sleep here, we were 4 and comfortable. Clean apartment, AC worked great, bathroom was spacious with plenty of room to dress. I would highly recommend staying here if you are wanting a place where you can walk to most places. Would stay again! "
22335,85256486,2016-07-10,53734911,Carlota,"Elena's place was wonderful!  The location was excellent.  We were able to walk everywhere quickly and enjoyed all the cafe's and restaurants nearby.  The apartment itself was adorable, clean and comfortable.  I would definitely stay there again!"
22335,85747810,2016-07-13,1289936,Jhon,"Elena made us feel great. We arrived before check-in and she was kind enough to let us check in early and be able to get some rest after a long flight before exploring magnificent Rome. The apartment was in great conditions, super clean, and wonderfully located within walking distance from every major attraction. We never had to use public transportation/Taxis during our stay. The apartment is a few blocks from Piazza Navona, 15-20 minutes from Vatican City, and less than 5 minutes from the Tiber River's Ponte Sant'Angelo and Bernini's masterpieces. 

Would definitely stay again!"
22335,86984840,2016-07-18,78610228,Mariana,"The neighborhood is really great, with narrow streets and small restaurants. Very close to Vatican, and walking distance to Piazza Novona. A bit far from Colosseo area. The apartment could be cleaner. The internet was of poor quality. These are points for improvement. We did enjoy our stay in Rome."

22335,90784351,2016-08-02,2180132,Michaella,"The apartment is centrally located. Wifi was out for about 24 hours, but was then fixed. Elena was easy to communicate with and very responsive. Place was clean and large. Overall a great Airbnb experience!"
22335,91649489,2016-08-06,55027381,Martin,"Communication beforehand was great and accommodation was sufficient for 6 adults. We only used this as a place to sleep over one night in Rome so didnt use the kitchen facilities. The location was great. We had a problem with the bathroom (no hot water) but the host did everything the could to resolve it before we left, albeit unsuccessfully. Hopefully a redolution will now be made. Entering the apartment complex is an awful bin smell as the main rubbish bin is kept inside by the front door of the complex. This was August but perhaps could be located elsewhere - just a suggestion."
22335,97510404,2016-08-27,5432169,Eva,"Nice and clean apartment! ElenaÂ´s friend welcomed us at the check-in and check-out, everything went very smooth. The apartment is located in a very nice area close to everything you want to see in Rome. "

22335,155628607,2017-05-28,52720907,Marlena,"Elena's apartment was a described, the best part was the location. The apartment has little natural light and is very loud in the night and early morning. The furnishings are simple and the beds are not comfortable. Be very careful to read Elena's check in policy carefully as you will be charged a very high fee of 45 euros in cash upon arrival if you get into Rome after the designated time. This makes the cost of staying quite high and not worth the budget condition of the home. We were charged this and the city tax which ended being 60 euros, almost as much as an entire nights stay at the apartment, even after very clearly communicating our time of arrival at 9:15 pm. "

22335,164133638,2017-06-26,9286060,Xue,"Elena's place was in the heart of Rome, and easily walkable to any of the main attractions. Despite its central location, it was on a small side street that was mostly shielded from busy crowds and traffic, so was relatively quiet, and felt very safe. I never felt unsafe even though I was alone. Although amenities are basic, there was everything you need to have a pleasant stay at the apartment. Just a warning: the place is up a few flights of narrow stairs - not easy with a lot of luggage!"

In der NÃ¤he gibt es auch einen Supermarkt. Die Wohnung selbst ist sauber und zweckmÃ¤Ãig. Nur die Klimaanlage der Nachbarn darunter ist etwas laut, was uns nachts aber nicht gestÃ¶rt hat.

Solo tuvimos dos inconvenientes, uno que a la llegada nos cobraron 40 euros por la limpieza, algo que en ningÃºn lado de la publicaciÃ³n decÃ­a, y el segundo, la vajilla e implementos de cocina estaban mal lavados, lo cual le reclamamos a Elena, e inmediatamente lo soluciono.

We had to sleep with earplugs every night because of hallway and upstairs noise. It is not directly on Piazza Navona, though it is close. There is also no hot tub as listed. I would stay again if some details are sorted out."

But there is no bubble bath as it says on the advert and the washing machine I couldnât use because it was mild and some paper in it!?!"

22335,434029466,2019-04-07,56776281,Xukun,"The place is larger than we expected, and very clean. We enjoyed the stay of 3 nights. The location is close to Vatican and 2 mins away from Angle's bridge. There are a lot of activities around the apartment, but the apartment itself is on a side street so not noisy during the night. There is only one AC in the main bedroom, and it is not a problem for us as we did not use the living room bed. All messages sent to the host were responded very promptly. We requested an early check in and Elena was able to accommodate. They also arranged a taxi service for us as we were flying out of FCO very early in the morning. Overall, it was a nice stay and I would definitely recommend it."
22335,436089356,2019-04-12,31790718,Regina,"There was no kettle, we boiled water in a saucepan. Weifai did not work well. In general, a normal apartment. Great location."
22335,438694869,2019-04-17,5050193,Hillary,"So- overall a fine apt in a great location. The apt has all basic necessities and futons for beds. It is an easy home base to go out and explore all Rome has to offer. It worked well for a family as we enjoy being cozy, but if I was there with a group of friends, this would have probably felt cramped. We arrived at Elena's apt within the time frame we gave her (between 4-430p). As the address was not exact as to which apt it was in the building, we waited outside after messaging via Airbnb that we had arrived. After 15 min, a man who was not Elena opened a window to greet us. He let us in and called me by correct first name, different last name. We got inside the apt and the photos did not look like the listing on Airbnb. The man knew nothing about Airbnb. I told him we were supposed to meet Elena, he said she couldn't make it. I was about to call Airbnb but then on second glance of listing, saw that photos are just taken in a way to make apt look nicer than actually is. They are all very close up so you cannot see how sparse it is- but it was the correct place. The man then asked us for the tax: 3.50euro per person per night in cash. This was more than the cash we had on us. He said we could go to ATM to get it then and bring back to him. Or offered we could go later, leave it on the kitchen table and he would just let himself in anytime to come get it. This was extremely unsettling that this man would feel he could let himself into the apt at any time during our stay without warning. Our young children were totally freaked out by this as well. We felt we could not leave valuables in the apt. The man seemed nice- but the whole situation was uncomfortable. We chose to get the cash immediately and give it to him. After an initial bad impression things improved and the apt was definitely functional for our stay in Rome. Thank you for having us! Positives: - great location: very easy to walk anywhere in Rome (even with small kids)- especially to Vatican, Piazza Navona & Pantheon. - there is a grocery store (Coop) 5-10 min walk away by Pantheon, it is small and expensive compared to other Coop's that we had just visited in Venice, but had most of the items we needed to make dinners and breakfasts during our stay. -basic kitchen- mini fridge, stove, microwave. no oven, no freezer. Has basic utensils and cooking items- enough to make dinner in apt every night. - sleeps up to 6 people -table seats 5 people if you pull out extenders (and use all chairs) -ample towels, toilet paper, dish soap, trash bags and shampoo. No laundry detergent. -2 tvs -wifi- though barely worked in bedroom. -easy check out of just leaving the key and locking up. -REALLY REALLY REALLY great location. Possible negatives: -apt is small and sparse- 1 bedroom, a living room/entryway with a futon in it that takes up the entire space, small kitchen and bathroom- with usual tiny Italian shower. Worked for our family- but may be difficult for a group of friends. No other furniture to sit on that isnt a bed or kitchen table/chair. -bathroom had 2 doors. Neither closed all the way. At best closed 2/3 of way. Good thing we were all friendly. . . -beds are 2 ikea futons and 1 cot- futons more comfy than cot. All VERY short to ground (I am 5'6"", not excessively tall)- the nightstand and beds came to my mid calf. 2 of the beds are in 1 room and 1 is in the living room/entry way. -no extra blankets or pillows (though there was heat and AC) -bathroom was moldy all around shower and on ceiling-- though I can understand with constant guests would be hard to keep it ventilated and well cared for. -smallest washing machine I've ever seen in all of Italy- fit about 1 days worth of clothes for 2 adults. - so we just did laundry more frequently. -no where to hang clothes to dry, had brought my own clothesline and had to hang it on chairs as there was no outside line like usual Italian apts. (at least there wasn't a lot to hang at once since washer so tiny). - drying rack for dishes above sink was so high I could not put the dishes in or out without standing on a chair (I am 5'6""). -You can hear EVERYTHING that happens in the apt building- I am guessing the whole building is rented out to vacationers as we saw several groups of non Italians arriving on different days- but you can hear when the groups of people get home at midnight or get up at 3am and run around or every time they come and go up and down the communal stairs- especially in the late night hours (after 11pm) as was the case during our stay. (that being said, I am sure everyone else enjoyed my 5 year old's tantrums but those were at 5p and 7p and were mainly regarding that he was scared the man who checked us in was going to come into the apt and take his stuffed animals). This was not really a problem for our stay- but could be for others. - with the futon in the entry way/living room out, there is little room to put stuff when you enter the apt and no where else to sit that is not a bed. Would be really nice to have a coat rack or something to put shoes/coats/bags on. Overall the apt was in a great location and had basic necessities. It served us well for our trip to Rome with a..."
22335,440010984,2019-04-20,2215854,Jennille,"This apartmentâs pros are that itâs huge, lots of space and probably will do best in the summer months as itâs cool-cold in the apartment. It had lots of sleeping spaces. I found the main bed a little hard so I opted to sleep on the pull out couch in the bedroom that was much softer. Cons are that you can hear every single sound from the people above the apartment as well as anyone in the building. Iâm guessing thatâs due to how the apartment was made. When the front door of the building slams thereâs this back echo of air that bangs against the bedroom window. It scared me every time on the first night. Thereâs a 2 flight walk up and that was tedious with luggage. The person that checked me in helped with carrying the luggage up thankfully. Another con was that I was only given 25% of a roll of toilet tissue for my two night three day stay. I communicated this to the host but was never brought any extra. I searched the home and didnât find any either. This didnât make sense to me given that the man who checked me in mentioned that the host live 3 minutes away. Check out was easy."

The house is comfy and, most of all, in great position: just a couple of minutes walking from Castel Sant'Angelo, which basically means you don't need to use any means of transportation to reach most places. Also, the communication with the host was perfect. Everything went smoothly and I'd definitely recommend this house to visit the center of Rome!"

El unico incoveniente fue que el Wi-Fi era malisimo y la mayor parte de nuestra estadia  no tuvimos conexion a internet.

Otra cosa que fue un poco rara fue el cobro de impuestos. En nuestro caso fueron 42 euros, una  cantidad que se me hizo excesiva. Ademas  no tenia efectivo y tuve que ir a un atm a retirar dinero para despues regresar y pagar, situacion que fue muy inconveniente y extraÃ±a, ya que  la aplicaciÃ³n especÃ­fica claramente que no tenemos que   dar dinero en efectivo a nuestros anfitriones a la llegada.

En resumen, buen departamento, me volveria a quedar.  Solo que la aplicacion tiene que aclarar el pago del impuesto."

22573,36642,2010-04-19,506640,Mandy,"Our stay at Francesco's was really great. His apartment has a very convenient location which makes it very easy to get everywhere. About a twenty minute walk to the colosseum, and where almost all the tourist attractions are, and a five minute walk to Termini station which will take you directly to most tourist attractions without the walk. He was very hospitable and made us feel right at home, apartment is very clean and spacious. 
I highly recommend staying with Francesco when you are in Rome!

22573,42206,2010-05-14,90220,Sylvia,"Wonderful room in great loction.  Yes.  Great space- not an outrageous time, but peaceful and secure.  I felt safe and looked after.  Would suit couples or individuals looking for some time out.  Mattress had a little to be desired, and the clock on the wall was a pain, but overall, a wonderful room in a great location!"
22573,47174,2010-05-28,115365,Alex,"Francesco's place was perfect for people that dread the sterile, hotel experience. His unique humor and style fills the rooms with a great character, and it was a pleasure to have a real home as our resting place after long days of tourism in Rome. Despite living with him, we barely saw him, and this well-calculated distance makes the place feel like your own. The location requires the use of public transportation, but so does every location in Rome, and his place at least is very close to Termini Station, the largest travel hub. I would stay here again!"

The location is fine;there was some noise from the street but we fell asleep without problems.
The walk from Termini takes about 25 minutes. bus 105 takes you close to the loft in 10 mins. 
Francesco was easy to contact and ready to answer.
We hope to be back asap.




"
22573,140698,2010-11-17,248204,Fanny,"As other reviewers have said, Francesco is a great host. Even though he had to work the day I planned to check in, he dropped off the keys with me the night before. It was very much appreciated and made my planning easier.

Francesco was easy to contact, responsive and helpful. His place was very clean and comfortable. It would have been better for my friend and I if the bathroom have a door tho. :) 

We didn't try walking out to the major sights, but bus 105 comes often and that was helpful. For those who will be taking that bus just make sure you have a valid ticket. We got checked twice on that route, good thing we had our tickets.

I travelled in Italy for six weeks, and this was one of the nicer airbnb places I stayed in. The coffee was great, but I still feel bad about staining his white rug. "
22573,166429,2011-01-05,278081,Ashley,"Francesco was a wonderful host and his apartment in Roma was beautiful, filled with vintage collectibles and beautiful artwork (an an amazing book & film collection). It's near the Pigneto District which is filled with authentic, true Roman restaurants and small pubs. We walked all the way to the Colosseum (3 KM) and onward to the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, & Vatican City- probably 15 KM in all... it's a good hike, but we enjoyed the adventure and subsequent scenery. Francesco left us cookies & snacks & good advice of restaurants and neighborhoods not to be missed. "
22573,230558,2011-04-18,477329,Jemi,"I arrived at Francesco's apartment really late and he was waiting for me to leave me the keys. He is a really nice guy and the apartmenr was fantastic.  His place is around 3 km outside the central, however very easy to access.  I took the bus 810 from right across the street and the last stop is Piazza Venezza.

He was a great host and the place was stunnÄ±ng! I reccomend Francesco's place to everyone!"
22573,245665,2011-04-30,474736,Trevor,"Francesco was very helpful, and considerate. The flat itself was very clean, and exactly as described in the listing and photos. Pigneto is a fantastic neighbourhood. Artists have been flocking to the lofts there in recent years, and it has given the neighbourhood a very bohemian feel - It was a great escape after touring the sites each day. The area reminds me a bit of Shoreditch in East London. 

It's within very easy reach of the train station and other attractions downtown. I would definitely like to stay here again if my travels bring me to Rome. 

Thanks Francesco!"
22573,264045,2011-05-15,354794,Chiara,Francesco's place is really nice and with a fantastic interior design. The area is very trendy with good restaurants and bars close-by. I would certainly recommend staying at his place if you go to Rome.
22573,270784,2011-05-19,513164,Michelle,Francesco is very friendly and helpful.  He reacts to any comments ror needs with great politeness and gets it done straight away.  The apartment is very clean and well made.  It is a bit of an adventure to get there with the tram but once that is mastered everything is great.
22573,280912,2011-05-25,480322,Joel,Francesco was a great host to deal with! Great place in a close enough apartment to feel like a real roman :) could not get wifi though which was the only down fall of stay. Would use again if ever in Rome! Thank you Francesco! :) 
22573,296857,2011-06-04,529740,Rachael,"The apartment itself was wonderful and spacious, with charmingly modern decor. Francesco was very nice, and provided us with breakfast foods and the required amenities when we moved in. The location of the apartment however, was not ideal and was situated right next to a highway (noisy all night) and in the middle of a rather run down area. That being said, if you can get over the noise, graffiti and general run-down state of the area it is very convenient to take a tram or bus to the main terminal (Roma Termini)."
22573,329713,2011-06-23,501827,Martin,"Our stay at Francesco was the best! The neighbourhood is really cool and authentic with good restaurants and a great nightlife. The flat is spacious and beautiful with everything you need including a fast Internet connection (contrary to what someone said, there is an Internet connection; you just have to ask Francesco for the password!)

Highly recommended! :)"
22573,511304,2011-09-07,528792,Alex,"My stay in Rome was great, thanks to this rental hosted by Francesco.  He was clear and prompt in his responses to anything I needed to ask.  The space was really cool: a clean, loft feel in Pigneto, a super trendy part of town.  Francesco was also very accommodating, including a last minute stopover with an additional guest.  I'd recommend Francesco, and the loft to anyone seeking a great Roman getaway for short or longterm. Thanks again FM!"

22573,608590,2011-10-08,843442,Justin,"We arrived at the apartment but Francesco was running late .He kindly directed us to a cafe close by while we waited for him and even paid for our drinks! The apartment was spacious and very nicely decorated. He provided us with details on how to get into the city, catching either the 810 to Piazza Venezia or the 105 to the station. The area had a great selection of restaurants and great young vibe - definitely recommended."
22573,626854,2011-10-13,1121114,Christina,"We had a very nice stay at Francesco's place. The location was right on the bus line that takes your about 10 minutes to the main termini station. The place was clean, had everything we needed, and wifi worked great. Only advice is that this place should be marketed as a one bedroom, not two. We had three people and the 2nd bed is a cot. Also, the master bedroom does not have a door. It's more like a really big studio. Francesco was very helpful and answered all my questions quickly. I would stay here again! "
22573,652178,2011-10-22,496087,Jonathan,Francesco has a unique eye for design which gives the apartment a great decor.  It looks just like the pictures.  Francesco and I messaged many times before I booked that apartment.  He was extremely cooperative and acquired a pull out bed for our third guest.  The apartment was reasonably priced in a up and coming part of time.  One note is that the apartment was a little smoky because many of the Italians smoke. The neighborhood was youthful and the nightlife was active.  The apartment is about a 45 minute walk from Rome's tourist attractions.  We decided to take a taxi to the city center which was a little challenging because taxis do not frequent the neighborhood.  Francesco recommended the public transportation which is nearby.
22573,673856,2011-10-29,919047,"Ronele, Mitch And Illy","STAY HERE!!! Francesco's place is stylish, clean and located just near the centre of Roma. All public modes of transport are right outside his doorstep and a cute little supermarket(Sigma)100m up the street make staying here really convenient and carefree. The style of this place, and of Francesco himself, make you feel at home as soon as you arrive. Great communication, flexible checking times and a beautiful apartment make staying at Francesco's an easy choice. We would stay here again for sure and recommend it to anyone heading to Roma. Cheers Francesco"

22573,834776,2012-01-03,138850,Omar,"Awesome pad in the heart of Rome. Stayed here with my girlfriend and found the place clean, very tastefully decorated, and well connected to Termini via the tramway just a few steps from the flat. Francesco was also a very helpful and welcoming host with a lot of tips on where to hang out, eat, and party in Rome. He's into the underground electronica scene sonic you are too he's the man to go to. 

One small note: there is no elevator to the flat (or at least we didn't see one) and its up a few floors above ground. Just be aware in case you can't make it up or are carrying heavy bags.  "
22573,976469,2012-03-06,835646,David,"Great space.  Very unique neighborhood.  It is not in the center of the city, but there is a bus and tram that takes you directly into Termini - which made it easy for me to get to the airport on the last day of my stay.  I would enjoy staying there again on my next trip to Rome."
22573,1098491,2012-04-08,1883039,Julie,"Francesco's apartment is amazing, it's even cooler than the pictures can express. If I lived in Rome, Pigneto is definitely the neighborhood I would want to be in. It's a little rough on the edges, but it seemed to be the place where the most interesting people were, and there were great restaurants and nightlife. (Necci and Primo were my favorites.) It reminded me of where I live in Brooklyn. Francesco was a great host, timely and courteous. I have already recommended his apartment to my friends visiting Rome in a few months."
22573,1113739,2012-04-12,1868282,Radislav,"We want to thank Francesco for the great time we had in the Rome. The apartment is very beautiful, clean and cosy, a lot of lovely details all over the place. Francesco is a wonderful host, he met us even a bit earlier then we were expected, and told us about neighbourhood, where to eat, where to shop, how to call a taxi, and was always ready to help.

Although the district first appeared to us a little insecure (bunches of migrants were staying here or there), it turned out it was only a first view. We didn't any have problems  walking in the streets at night, etc.

Pity we couldn't manage to get into the nearby restaurant recommended by Francesco, as every time we came in, it was either closing or not open yet :)"
22573,1142996,2012-04-17,1825095,Alexia,"The appartment is very nicely decorated, clean, and very confortable, though a bit noisy (car trafic) ; but we got used to it and it wasn't a problem after all. 
Pigneto is a nice neighbourhood, has good places to eat, little restaurants..."
22573,1174990,2012-04-24,166375,Jessica,"Francesco's place is just like it is in the photos (perhaps even better!). After being out in Rome's incredibly touristy central area every day, it was amazing to come home to a beautifully decorated apartment in a neighborhood with great food and bars that was far from the busloads of tourists. Even with it being outside of the touristy areas, it was still easy to get to the central area of the city via tram or bus, or even just walking. The apartment was safe and clean and just perfect for our needs. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Francesco! "
22573,1204641,2012-04-30,1887976,Marek,"Francesco's loft is awesome. Its very stylish and cozy. We enjoyed hanging out in the spacious kitchen, especially in the evening. The area feels a bit like Berlin. An interesting contrast to the more picturesque areas like Trastevere. Nearby are several nice apperativo bars. The only downside is the traffic noise, but it did not affect us much."
22573,1293934,2012-05-17,1916078,Artur,"May, 2012. Exactly as advertised! You'll love the design. A bit off the historic center, but very well connected by public transport. Francesco was very responsive. We locked our keys in the apartment and he was there in 30 minutes to let us in. Thanks again! "
22573,1351786,2012-05-26,1708923,Mariana,"My best friend and I stayed at Francesco's apartment during our weeklong stay in Rome. Francesco was incredibly helpful and recommended places for us to eat, visit, and go out. He was very understanding and patient with us, even when we locked ourselves out of the apartment!
If I'm ever in Rome (or any other location where Francesco rents out an apartment), I will definitely rent his space again! "
22573,1424854,2012-06-06,559186,Eva,"Francesco has an amazing flat in a great part of town! He was a great host, really responsive and welcoming - we felt at home!

The flat is even better than the pics, really tastefully decorated! It was great to get away from the tourist areas in Rome and hang out in Pigneto. Really enjoyed lunch in Primo and dinner in Necci but there were plenty more places to eat/drink in. The area has a great vibe about it and it's perfect if you want to get a flavour of the real Rome! 

The flat does tend to get a bit noisy at night though but after a few Negronis it wasn't really an issue :-)"
22573,1483411,2012-06-15,1513967,Ariel,"Francesco's apartment is absolutely incredible! It's honestly one of the most stylish and well furnished apartments we had ever seen. It's in a good location which requires just one tram in order to get into the city centre. It's super clean and so comfortable, to the point where we never wanted to leave! We only got the chance to meet Francesco once, but he was such a lovely and welcoming guy and communication was very easy making check in/check out a breeze. We will definitely return to this stunning apartment on our next visit to Rome, and highly recommend it to everyone else!"
22573,1963402,2012-08-12,2925935,Caitlin,"Francesco's home was in such an authentically cool part of Rome, the decor was amazing, and all of the communication with Francesco was really simple. "
22573,2245800,2012-09-10,1349512,Michael,"Francesco's apartment is fantastic! Modern, bright and very comfortable in a great area brimming with life. It's a great design, well renovated with great facilities too, it was a pleasure to be in the apartment when we weren't out enjoying everything the local area and Rome had to offer. Francesco was a perfect host, who was friendly and happy to be contactable for anything. His recommendations on the area were spot on too. I would definitely stay here again, the nicest place we found in Rome. Thank you Francesco! "
22573,2393153,2012-09-24,626054,Dimitry,"If you stay in Rome, look no further than this apartment. I had a great stay at Francesco's. He's a sweetheart and his apartment met my expectations.

The apartment is not in a central location and if your daily budget is high, perhaps this neighborhood will feel a little too young and far from the action. For me, it was just the thing. Not too expensive and close enough that I did not feel too far from the sights and the nightlife.

Francesco was a great host and was kind enough to show me around the area. Public transportation was everywhere and it took at most half an hour to reach any place I wanted to go (even without taking a single bus)."
22573,2497709,2012-10-03,414010,Sofi,"Excellent apartment, in a lovely part of Rome"
22573,2803947,2012-11-04,3812145,Romain,"Nice flat, nice decoration, nice owner... 
We had a really good time in this apartment, located in a popular area of Roma. I also have to admit that Francesco has been really cool as he waited for me and my girlfriend until 1am to get back the keys, given our late arrival at the airport from Paris, France.
He's been very flexible for check-in and check-out, which made our romantic week-end in Roma much more cooler;-)"
22573,3478810,2013-02-04,286473,Matteo,"Great host, wonderful apartment, perfect location. If you visit Rome, stay here, highly recommended! "
22573,3530885,2013-02-12,359503,Ricardo,"This loft in Pigneto was just the best way to kick in Rome. It's got the great bohemian style around this young and off-the-beaten track area lined up with cool bars and restaurants (I'd strongly recommend Primo a couple blocks behind the building). Francesco has a serious eye on design, around the flat there's a stunning selection of mind-blowing pieces from Castiglione, Chesterfield and french Tolix chairs. 
Lighting is also spotlessly chose, together with retro details and raw refurbishment that adds to a whole urban experience. Since I had confirmed rather short-notice he had to leave his clothing drying on the bookshelf part, so it was a bit humid inside. The noise from the old (but super cool) refrigerator can be of distractive to some, I was mostly concerned about the open food inside. 

Out of all, I would definitely recommend this flat to urban/design-oriented people who are looking for a insider experience in old Rome. Enjoy your time in the city!"
22573,3637260,2013-02-26,5100268,Julien,"Francesco's apartment is cosy and very comfortable, not to mention the fantastic decoration, photos do not lie. My wife and I had a wonderful three days lovers week-end, the quality of this place took a great part in it.  

If you are fond of book stores and books in general, you'll be blown away by Francesco's geometric book shelves.

Also, I have to mention that Francesco was a kind host, waiting for us to arrive from airport as we were trapped in traffic jam inside Rome. He recommended us a list of ristorantes . Amon them, we had time to go to Necci, a couple of blocks from Francesco's flat. Great food and place!

"
22573,4003596,2013-04-02,2175481,Daphne,"Francesco's apartment was absolutely gorgeous and extremely convenient to centro storico and termini (the tram stops literally in front of the apartment) while being far from the touristy hordes. Pigneto itself is a diverse and artistic neighborhood with loads of great places to eat and drink (tavolo ventisette being my personal favorite). Francesco was responsive and accommodating. The ONLY problem with the apartment is that there is a fair amount of traffic noise. Otherwise, it was absolutely perfect."
22573,4499215,2013-05-08,1591695,Igor,"Excellent place, though a big noisy.
Very cosy and excellent atmosphere, and Francesco was very helpful!"
22573,4746004,2013-05-23,5915805,Sara,"Me and my friend had a great stay at Francesco's flat. It's very cool, and I've been thinking about stealing his idea for bookshelves since the first time I entered the apartment. One of us used the bedroom and one of us the inflatable bed, both was very comfortable. The flat is on a street with traffic all through the night, so if you're a light sleeper, don't forget your earplugs. 

Francesco was not in Rome when we arrived or left, but the check in/out was not a problem. 

I loved Pigneto, a real haven away from the tourist masses in the more central parts of Rome. For eating, I can recommend Rosti, and don't miss I Porchettini if you like your pork. "
22573,4793838,2013-05-26,5537026,Yung & Annie,Francesco's place is very cool. We had a relaxing stay.  Slept really well in his comfortable bed. Pigneto neighborhood  is a lot of fun as right around the corner are bars and good food. We found the tram and bus system to be very convenient. Francesco wasn't around because of his busy acting career but he was attentive to our suggestions and very helpful. I'm sure future guests will enjoy his place. Ciao ciao!
22573,5334801,2013-06-24,3654143,Alina,"Host & apt are great! Very good! 
Thanks for everything!"
22573,5464947,2013-07-01,6786496,Andrew,Had a lovely stay at Francesco's apartment. Comfortable bed. Nicely decorated. Bit noisy in the morning but it meant we got up and enjoyed the city! 3 of us stayed here and the airbed worked well. Great tram link to the centre of town. Would certainly recommend staying here. 
22573,5668882,2013-07-10,7256694,Ashe,Great host and lovely apartment. I wasn't bothered by the traffic noise as it helped having the fan on. The only thing that really frustrated me about Rome in general was the difficulty in getting around with public transport - but I am a Londoner so anything more than a 5 minute wait is too much for me. Thanks for a great stay.
22573,5753065,2013-07-15,12602,Nathan,"We never met Francesco himself but his place is amazing.  Super stylish but comfortable.  Francesco has fantastic taste!

Pigneto is a very up and coming and hip area (not many tourists around).  There are some really cool coffee-shops/ bars in the area."
22573,7057979,2013-09-04,5448023,Gabriel,"Francesco was very cooperative and helpful in arranging the place! 

The apartment is nicely furnished and has a good vibe. The downside is that due to the traffic outside it is at times noisy and this continuous often through the night. A more sound proof glazing may help. 

All in all this was a pleasurable experience and I could recommend booking here. "
22573,7558254,2013-09-24,4932415,Kian Lee,"Francesco's loft was lovely and well styled. It gives a good taste to living 'local', closed to street of bars and restaurants away from tourists. There was a cute bar downstairs for quick breakfast and the girls at the counter became our default 'concierge'. The room does gets noisy in the morning due to the corner location to main road (it is part of city living). Our hot water was not working well on first night but Francesco was quick to response to any queries we had and giving instructions to assist. We had some difficulty getting to the location on the first day. It is also not as easy getting public transport from here on weekends. Give some time to catch the buses/trams nearby. At other times cabs to and fro this place are reasonable priced. It is not the most convenient location from the 'tourist' spots of Rome but I love that we experienced an area that is quirky and lived in a typical Rome apartment that has been updated for modern living. "
22573,7620926,2013-09-27,2727880,Jacqueline,"Beautifully designed apartment, cosy and clean. Excellent atmosphere, great vibe. Thank you Francesco for being so kind and helpful! "
22573,12085695,2014-04-22,5704315,Alex,"Francesco's place is amazing! Definitely the most comfortable bed in Italy, maybe in Europe, and being a New Yorker I felt right at home in Pigneto which is fantastic as it hasn't been totally blown outâ¦YET! I would highly recommend his placeâ¦it's also a steal!!!!! Francesco was cool and very easy to deal with. "
22573,12557641,2014-05-05,1800016,Matthieu,"We had a great time at Francesco's cosy flat, which held all its promises and more! 

We initially chose Pigneto as it was basically one of the few neighborhoods where nice places such as Francesco's were still available. We ended up in love with the area: real people, real food, and hardly 30 minutes from the gems of Centro Storico. "
22573,13189117,2014-05-21,4585061,Nick,"Francesco was very helpful with our stay and we loved his apartment. It's decorated very well  and extremely comfortable. To be honest we were nervous when we first arrived and walked around the neighborhood as it felt sketchy to us, but we never had any problems at all. We absolutely loved the market and restaurants just down the street and we spent a lot of time there. Catching a taxi was never difficult and most times we just walked into the city center, which was about two miles, not as bad as it sounds. But when we go back, we might stay closer to the center next time."
22573,14654148,2014-06-23,4995002,Gabe,"This is a great flat in a good neighbourhood. Francesco was a really good host and made everything incredibly easy. I'd definitely stay here again! Very comfortable, clean and also just an interesting space."
22573,16680647,2014-07-31,13603224,Thomas Heldrup,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay in Francesco's loft. The loft was nice and clean and the check-in process went smooth. We meet Francesco briefly the first day but he was off to work so that was the only time we saw him. 

We were looking after a place in Rome that felt authentic and outside the main tourist area and we got exactly that. The loft is situated in a cool neighbourhood (Pigneto) with a daily market and a lot of cafÃ©s where local people hang out every night. There is also one of the best ice cream shops down on the corner which is a big plus if you love gelatto. 

We would highly recommend this as your place to stay in Rome!  "
22573,17114165,2014-08-07,18087912,Elizaveta,"apartment is pretty big and modern. bed is comfortable and interior is interesting. 
location is really far away from center, and it's incorrectly indicated on the map. 
And towels would be okay for a cheaper apartment, but we thought we were paying for a cool modern (Website hidden by Airbnb) closet was very dirty and disgusting. 
when we were trying to cook we saw bug in salt. 
so be careful to chose this apartment 


"
22573,20184715,2014-09-25,6195719,Meng-Ling,"Francesco is very sweet to greet us when we arrive. He's very quick with all our questions and gave us a good list of restaurants and even made reservation for us. Thanks to his recommendation, we had our best meal in ROMA at Primo. The apt is spacious and nicely decorated with beautiful vintage finds. The bed is comfortable. 

It's not in the very center of the city, but the transportation is convenient(trams & buses). It's like Bushwick(nowadays) in New York, full with new restaurants, bars, a local, edgy neighborhood. About 15~20 minutes to the center. 

It can be a little bit noisy at night. But overall we had a lovely stay at Francesco's place. Would recommend to someone who are interested in living a local Roman life and be away from the tourists noise. "
22573,21486167,2014-10-18,22153192,Alexander,"The appartement is fantastic, big and wonderful decorated. Pigneto is a great young and alterntive area for visting Rome with lots of good bars and Restaurants. You can easily reach everything by tram or bus with the stop direct in front of the appartement."
22573,21681368,2014-10-21,3465616,Judith,"Me and my friend spent a long weekend in Francesco's appartment. Everything was as described - the flat is not very in the center, but that is clearly shown on the map. And with a few stops on the tram you reach the main station easily. Handling keys, cleanness and communication were without hassle. Flat is super sunny and stylish.
The one negative thing, but this is very individual, is the noise from the many cars in front of the building. I am very sensitive with hearing, so it was maybe worse than it actually is. But to be honest, Rome IS loud, wherever you go. If you want it quiet, go to JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ in Finland. :) 
No reason why you should not rent the appartment."
22573,21897023,2014-10-26,1756575,Dietmar,"Very nice place and exactly as described. Although the host wasn't there everything worked out without any problems because we had an email with instructions in advance (how to get the keys and get around..).
Especially recommendations on food were good, thank you for that.
Would definetely come to this place again."
22573,22323121,2014-11-03,5848124,Claire,"Nous avons passÃ© un excellent sÃ©jour chez Francesco.

22573,25170737,2015-01-08,24123677,MÃ©lanie,"Francesco a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s facilement joignable malgrÃ© des contraintes professionnels. DÃ¨s notre arrivÃ©e dans le loft, nous avons Ã©tÃ© accueilli par quelques douceurs typiques.
L'appartement est absolument conforme aux descriptions: agrÃ©able, spacieux avec une dÃ©coration trÃ¨s sympa.
Nous avons pu y concocter quelques super plats de pates :-)
Le quartier nous a beaucoup plu: vivant, bien desservi par les transports.Une trÃ¨s bonne adresse a proximitÃ© pour les amateurs de pizza: Pizza Vulcano (Via del Pigneto 189)
Pour les personnes sensibles au bruit, prÃ©voir des bouchons d'oreilles car le cartier est vivant.
Super endroit pour dÃ©couvrir Rome."

22573,31477370,2015-05-05,6368251,Robert,"I had a great stay at Francesco's place in Rome. It was very close to the tram and a 10 minute ride to Roma Termini. The apartment was stylish and neat and the bed was even better than the one I have at home. It also came with great wi-fi.

There is a market and bakery nearby not to mention gelato. Highly recommend if you're looking for something quiet just outside the city center. Perfect for a single or couple.

Francesco was also quick to respond to all my questions and emails and turned out to be a very gracious host."
22573,32082457,2015-05-13,30286293,Jack,"Francesco's apartment was perfect for my girlfriend and I.
Very cool, trendy area which is close to all major sites.
Tram stop is right out the front and only about 10minutes from Termini.
Francesco was very hospitable upon arrival and easily reached when we needed to communicate.
Quirky decor with a homely vibe.
Highly recommended."
22573,34831351,2015-06-12,4215697,Amir,"Wonderful indeed, in every sense.
Francesco is easily one of the most charming, accommodating and helpful hosts I met.
His home in pigneto truly feels like a home in the best way- comfortable, beautiful, mind expanding.
Every detail was thought and cared of and every object is wonderful. From the sofa thru the lights and kitchen and all the way to bed- you will not want to get out of it. 
It's a special space for special people- 
Pigneto is great for those who wish to taste a deeper layer or current Roman life, and Francesco's loft is ideally located in its midst. 
super recommended. 
"
22573,45595635,2015-09-04,4215697,Amir,"Coming back to stay a longer period at Francesco's wonderful home was absolutely lovley. Everything was smooth even that Francesco was away, and he was super helpful from afar with everything I needed. 
What can I say, felt like home. This is what air bnb is made for I guess, dosent get any better. I Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a Roman experience beyond the tourist route and staying for more than 2 days, as pigneto takes time to get into... "
22573,46389233,2015-09-10,1284389,Sara,"Our stay at Francesco's apartment in pigneto was perfect! Such lovely and artistic home, and easy access to the tram (5 or 14) to take you to termini station. Everything was lovely and we would recommend this place for sure. The one thing to be aware of is the main street in front of the apartment can be a little scary at night, so if traveling alone be aware of that. Other than that there are amazing restaurants in the neighborhood. We ate better food in pigneto than we could find in the rest of where we traveled in Rome. Thanks Francesco for a wonderful stay."
22573,46908052,2015-09-14,38218182,Chen,"I had a wonderful time in the apartment! It was beautiful and comfortable- it felt like home! I didn't have the chance to meet Francesco, but he was great and helped us with everything we needed! "

22573,50189157,2015-10-10,198089,Michelle,"Francesco's apartment is as gorgeous as it looks on photos.  It was very clean, cozy and interesting.  Although it is located out of the touristy part of the city, it is nice to come back to a less tourist dense area.  Pigneto has a very trendy vibe which reminded me of my favourite spots in Manhattan - the East and West Village filled with great restaurants and bars favoured by the hip locals.  A bus stop is located just across the apartment which made it easy to get into the centre of Rome and to Termini train station.  Francesco was very welcoming and had sent me a very helpful list of his favourite haunts in the neighbourhood prior to my arrival.  Since I love eating I had tried three suggestions on his list, which I must say were on point and during the week's stay I had made repeat visits.  A great host, Francesco kept in touch via (Hidden by Airbnb) for anything I may have needed.  I was very satisfied with my stay in Rome and I highly recommend Francesco's property. I will definitely stay here the very next time I visit Rome.  Grazie Francesco !"
22573,66503168,2016-03-22,2603041,Hans-Peter,"Although Francesco was not at home during our stay, he has perfectly organized the handover of the keys and his friend Antonio was very welcoming. He also gave us great tips for restaurants in the Pigneto area and beyond. The flat is nicely furnished and conveniently located just a few meters away from a bus and tram stop. The area itself (which looks a bit rough on the first glance) offers lots of nice bars, restaurants and cafÃ©s and you can relax from the tourist crowds in the historic center. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay in Rome and I can definitely recommend staying with Francesco."
22573,68601097,2016-04-05,64456343,Uijin,"He was a great host showing his hospitality with a bottle of wine and sweet chocolates.

22573,77377953,2016-05-31,42703391,August," Let me begin by saying that Francesco is a very warm and welcoming host who made me feel comfortable immediately. He gave me a tour of the apartment showing me everything that I might need. The loft is well appointed and very cozy. His has to be the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on!! Francesco also provided a document that describes the neighborhood bars and restaurants as well as how to get around Roma. Moreover, Francesco was very accessible whenever I had a question. The apartment is very quiet as well. "

The location of the apartment is just perfect! You could use trams 5 or 14 just across the street to get the Termini station in 10 minutes...  The neighborhood is full of nice restaurants! 
And the host Francesco... he was quite accessable and very kind to give answers promptly. He shares  very useful ""what to do"" list and ""tips"" list if you have no agenda... Overall, it was just one of the perfect staying experiences that I enjoyed a lot. You actually stay in between cruising the city and staying in and enjoying the apartment with a nice bottle of wine! "
22573,100386372,2016-09-09,8233362,Phylicia,Francesco was very welcoming and provided plenty of useful information (from how to get to his place to where to go in town) even before we arrived. He was easily contactable and super responsive and his place was exactly as pictured. The neighbourhood is a short travel away from the main tourist spots but quite easy to get too and he has the advantage of having a super comfortable bed and one of the best gelatos we've tried in Rome (and we tried a lot) round the corner.

La posizione e' magnifica: vicino a tutti i locali del pigneto e servitissima per raggiungere qualsiasi punto della citta'.
Francesco e' stato un host perfetto: preciso nelle comunicazioni, disponibile, molto simpatico.
Sicuramente prenotero' ancora la sua casa e non posso che consigliarla vivamente a tutti!"

22573,269472877,2018-05-27,16057198,Fiona,"Francescoâs apartment is exceptionally stylish and makes a great base for exploring Rome.
Just 8 stops/15 minutes on the tram from Termini it is conveniently close but also just far enough away from the heat and crowds of central Rome.
Pigneto is a fantastic friendly neighbourhood with a great selection of local restaurants.
Francesco is responsive but unobtrusive, greeted us in person despite us arriving fairly late on a Thursday night - his suggestion of restaurants were spot on too. A lovely first experience of Rome!"
22573,273172587,2018-06-05,118297476,Antoinette,"Me and my boyfriend just got back from Rome and we already miss Francescoâs place! Not only the loft but the neighborhood. We specifically wanted to stay out the city center so if you do too, this is the place to stay. The neighborhood was inviting and and the vibe was cool. We loved the restaurants which were way better than the touristy areas and the diversity made us feel at home. The loft was clean, cozy and the decor was amazing. Looks just like the photos. Francesco is a cool guy and communicating was a breeze. I will definitely stay here again when visiting Rome. "
22573,275603173,2018-06-11,115361511,Manuel,"Francesco Ã¨ una persona gentilissima e molto cordiale. Lâappartamento, accogliente e bellissimo, ci ha permesso di soggiornare serenamente durante tutti i giorni!"
22573,278497309,2018-06-18,77326009,Jane,"Francescoâs place is a lovely spacious and stylish apartment with easy access to Pignetoâs main pedestrian and restaurant area (about 2 minutes walk) which is great for night life, and only 1 minute walk across the road from the tram stop which goes directly to, Termini, the cityâs main train/bus/metro station.

Francesco was a great host with fantastic communication and we had a better stay then we could have hoped for. "
22573,307360612,2018-08-14,30807695,Benjamin,"First of all, Francesco is a great host - flexible and willing to work with you to meet your needs and do what he can to accommodate. The apartment is tastefully decorated and very unique. That being said, we stayed during a hot two weeks in August, and the apartment unfortunately lacks A/C. I'm not sure if this is common or not in Rome, but it was a rather perspirational experience ;). We had a few roadbumps along the way, but Francesco was always quick to respond and work with us to arrive at a solution."
22573,309431376,2018-08-18,76400167,Marco,"Appartamento veramente particolare e curato, come da fotografie

22573,325282406,2018-09-19,57450065,Azza,"Great place, looks better than the pictures! Francesco sent information about the area, restaurant recommended which was really helpful!  Would recommend this place to all travels, great transportation links. Only thing there is no air conditioning, but there is a fan which helped 

Overall great place and would stay again if ever in Rome"
22573,329520855,2018-09-29,63971989,Allison,"This apartment is very clean and neat. The furniture and decoration is pretty. The location is OK, very close to the Tram station. Francesco is very warm heart. He's trip advice is very helpful."

22573,487473396,2019-07-14,262048703,Iris,"Lovely apartment, well equipped, spacious and clean. Smart design, injected with style and personality. The location is super, loved the neighbourhoodâs soul in Pigneto, very well connected, public transport just in front of the main door and everything you need around the corner.  
Francesco, the host, could not be friendlier and more helpful, he went above and beyond to make me feel welcome.

Thoroughly enjoyed my stay â and I would definitely stay again!"

22573,599766656,2020-01-31,26297222,Laila,"Francescoâs place is absolutely amazing. Clean, full of style, stunning and very well connected. Francesco is great at communicating and even and gave me his friends number in case I needed help with anything due to him traveling for a few days.

You will not regret staying here. He has thought about everything to ensure you have a great stay. Oh! Also - the washing machine had been broken before I arrived and he made sure to let me know in advance and got a new one a week into me being there. 

Just a heads up - thereâs a hospital not too far away so sometimes at night you hear ambulances passing through but nothing that will keep you up at night. 

One of my best Airbnb experiences. Iâm already planning my return."
22573,658857551,2020-08-31,18404439,Rachel,"Hey!  Thank you for letting me stay.  I am grateful you opened up your home.   

I'd say the apartment has a lot of wear and tear and needs a deep cleaning.  When I arrived it was very dusty and smelled that way.  Having a housekeeper helped keep it manageable throughout my stay. 

Also, as a single woman, I didn't feel safe right outside the apartment (especially at night). 
 There is a lot of shady business happening right in front of the apartment.  Also, its along a really noisy road.  Given it was August I had to keep the windows open because there is no AC and it was sooo hot in Rome (which i knew in advance).  

Francesco was very responsive and apologized when his housekeeper canceled twice.  I did have a coin fall out of my pants into the washer but I paid for the repair.   

Thank you,  again Francesco.  I appreciate the opportunity to stay in your home.  I did like Pigneto's main street with restaurants.  It was quite lovely.  Just felt unsafe *right* in front of the apartment."
22573,725604782,2021-01-20,361287295,Flavia,"Staying at Francesco's place was great! I loved the apartment and the neighborhood which is lively and full of interesting shops. Francesco is very kind, easy to reach, and he always makes his best to meet your needs. I stayed for a few months and I really loved the experience."
22930,65554,2010-07-17,148620,Luis Carlos,"I spent four great days at Vicolo del Cedro 21, apartment 3!  The location was great, right in the middle of the historic Trastevere neighborhood.  Tons of restaurants, bars and shops nearby.  The apartment met all of our needs: clean, spacious and nicely designed/furnished.  Other pluses included a washing machine and free wifi.  The best part was the host, Sabrina!  Very helful with recommendations and accomodating our travel needs.  I would definitely go back again."
22930,99128,2010-09-17,220394,Irina,"We stayed in Cedro 3 for 3 nights. It was extremely pleasant experience. Sabrina is a very nice and helpful host. She took great care of us, even organized our pick-up from the airport. Her advices were very helpful. We like Sabrina's apartment: nice, cozy and spotlessly clean. Fully equipped kitchen, very comfortable bed, air conditioner, and of course, wonderful terrace on the roof. I would recommend Sabrina's place to all my friends and would be happy to stay there again when visiting Rome."

22930,150145,2010-12-07,267651,Matthew,"We had a great time staying in this apartment. It is comfortable and  clean, and has everything you need as a base to explore Rome. The area is excellent with lots of local cafes and restaurants. Sabrina was a great host and was a huge help in organising things like a taxi to the airport. I happily recommend staying here. "
22930,191618,2011-03-03,322254,Rachel,The apartment is wonderful and in a great area. And Sabrina is the best hostess! Would enthusiastically recommend to anyone.
22930,215591,2011-04-03,289049,Colin,Great apartment in a great location.  Sabrina was very helpful!
22930,260380,2011-05-12,390557,Ralph,We stayed in Cedro 4. Nice clean apartment in great location. Sabrina was a great host. I would caution larger people on the size of the shower in Cedro 4 the door would be a squeeze for larger people and possible unusable for some.
22930,264930,2011-05-16,324793,Caroline,"Sabrina est adorable, la terrasse et l'appartement trÃ¨s jolis! Sensibles au bruit s'abstenir."
22930,270701,2011-05-19,372940,Brian,"Sabrina was fantastic, the apartment was clear and suited us perfectly. The location cannot be beat. We were able to easily walk anywhere we wanted to go and we loved having the small, lively, slightly off the beaten bath village of Trastevere to come home to at night. "
22930,287416,2011-05-30,408615,Ken,"Sabrina was a wonderful host. There was a Rick Steves Restaurants with in 5-10 mins walk.  Everything was within walking distance.  Fast internet access. 7Mps. Bring your (Hidden by Airbnb) Navigation  enable phone / device and you will not get lost to the places you want to go. I felt safe and welcome.  The washing machine was great convenience,   and Sabrina showed my mom where to hang our clothes on the roof. And my mom doesn't even speak English. I will stay at Sabrina's home again  "
22930,349126,2011-07-03,242902,Ravee,Great location and great apartment.  I would definitely stay there again next time in rome and would recommend to anyone.  Sabrina is very nice and lived right next door (we were in apt 3 and she lives in apt 2).  Only slight issue was that the shower was very small in our apartment but we got used to it.  
22930,412223,2011-08-01,349439,Ct,"Sabrina was a great host. Very helpful. She provided the privacy I required while simultaneously being available for questions and concerns.  

Additionally, we stayed over a week and she scheduled a cleaning of our apartment halfway during our stay. Very good customer service, indeed!

I would stay here again and recommend that others book with Sabrina as well."
22930,505354,2011-09-06,687235,Laura,"ADORED Sabrina and the apartment, it was simply perfect!  My daughter is going to college in Trastavere and Sabrina went out of her way to assist me with all kinds of local information, helped my daughter adjust to her new city and simply made us feel at ease.  The apartment is in a perfect location- just far enough from the crowds  but a stones throw to the best coffee, amenities and food you can imagine!  The terrace is fantasic, the church bell is the pervasive sound...amazingly quiet.  This will be my apartment when visiting Rome every year.  Thank you!!  "
22930,959150,2012-02-28,1585296,Ulrike,"Sabrina has welcome us at a very charming appartment. The flat offers space enough for 2 persons. The flat is situated in a side way in a popular quater for going out. From the bar you are able to turn over straight into bed. As well in the daytime to get the sights shortly.  

Sabrina is being helpful and she is a very nice host. 
I very recommend this appartment in Trastevere! "
22930,1183295,2012-04-26,1373454,Crista,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The apartment was spotless and the location terrific.   Sabrina was a most gracious host going far beyond what we would have expected to be helpful.  She helped us with directions, buses and trains, printed out our Vatican Museum admission tickets and even led us on her scooter to return our rental car.  We couldn't have asked for anything more.  We would definitely return."
22930,1390662,2012-05-31,801209,Nicole,"Sabrina's pt was fantastic! Clean, great location, and cozy to come home to. She is well organized, and dependable. I will define toy book with her again! :)"
22930,1406344,2012-06-03,287038,Ilana,"""Cedro 3"" was the perfect location for our short stay in rome.  The apartment was centrally located and within walking distance of many of our daily destinations.  It offered just enough space for two with a simple, but nice bedroom, living room area and kitchen. It was just what we needed. Sabrina was great.  Very accessible, warm and helpful. She gave us a map of the area and helped to point out specific locations we might need during our stay. Trastevere is a wonderful neighborhood.  Tons of fantastic restaurants, cafes and bars.  Couldn't have asked for better.  Would definitely stay here again."
22930,2259512,2012-09-11,66338,Claire,"We enjoyed 16 nights in Via del Cedro 3.  As others have said, it is in a great position, only two minutes from lots of bars and cafes.  Despite its closeness to a lot of activity, we found it mostly quiet and peaceful.  It is a small apartment but has everything one needs for a holiday in Trastevere and is cosy.  It was also nice having access to a roof top terrace.  It was probably the best experience we have ever had of being welcomed to the apartment and it was great to know that we had a phone number to call Sabrina if we had any queries.
We also saw some of the slightly larger apartments and they also 
looked great.
Finally we found the tram 8 and bus H were great for helping us access the ancient centre of Rome and the metro.  Wish we were still there.
Claire and Richard"
22930,4871589,2013-05-30,2133243,Rachel,"We really enjoyed both the apartment and the neighborhood.  The apartment was perfect for two, and the roof-top made for an incredible and relaxing end to long days of walking.  We didn't get the chance to meet Sabrina, but Sebastien was a wonderful host.  We would definitely stay here again!  "
22930,5228769,2013-06-19,1505529,Brian,"Sabrina's place was great and in the absolute perfect location.  There was one minor malfunction with the plumbing, but otherwise a great spot for the price.  The roof deck is also a major plus."
22930,5450784,2013-07-01,5841508,Kasper,"The place was wounderful and very close to everything. Our host, Sabrina, was extremly helpful in every aspect. The appartment was clean and silent during the evenings. You should not expect any view from the windows as the the building is situated very close to other buildings.

We can strongly recommend this place again.  "
22930,6652997,2013-08-20,1665676,Moya,"My daughter and I had a fantastic week in Trastevere at Cedro 3.
Great apartment in a brilliant area. After a full day of sightseeing in Rome, only a bus ride away, it was great to come back to the lovely cool apartment with its beautiful roof garden to relax before going out to one of the wonderful and inexpensive local Trastevere restaurants. 
Very helpful advice from friendly Sabrina and Bernard. I totally recommend this apartment if you come to stay in Rome! Moya"
22930,12543601,2014-05-05,449172,Stefanie,"Sabrinaâs place is a great homebase for discovering Rome.  It is located in the middle of Trastevere â a very lively and beautiful district of Rome. We found it perfect for exploring the whole town â the city center(15 minutes walk), to the Colosseo (20 minutes walk) or the Vatikan (20 minutes walk).  Since it is in the middle of Trastevere, you have many fantastic restaurants â many touristy but very nice places but also some local spots â and bars just around the corner. It is located in a quiet street though â so not too loud during night.
It should be said that the place is quite simple â rather basic furniture, kitchen supplies and bathroom. But you will find everything you need for a long weekend stay and the roof top terrace is a great add-on and place to relax. 
Sabrina and her employee Sebastian welcomed us very friendly, gave great restaurant tips, organized our cab to the airport and were available any time. 
If you are looking for a simple place to stay at in a fantastic location, inside tips from locals, reliable hosts and a sun roof-top we definitely recommend Sabrinaâs apartment.
"
22930,13543677,2014-05-30,15071118,Matt,"Great host - Sabrina was very accommodating even when we had to check in late. Apartment was smaller than expected but then again, this is Europe. We had all the essentials including WiFi. The neighborhood is fantastic especially if you are looking for a younger crowd. They even had Karaoke night at one of the local bars!"
22930,20486185,2014-09-30,2620326,Willy,"Very nice apt, we had a great time, sleeping in the centre of Trastevere, in the morning having breakfast nearby on the streets, during the day wondering through Rome and in the evening having dinner around the corner of the apt. And the terrace on the roof is fabulous! Thanks a lot Sabrina, for this perfect place, it was clean and tidy, and we really felt at home! "

The appartment is in an area with cosy narrow streats, calm cafes and nicely located with walking distance to many of the historical places that we wantes to visit. The house it self also comes with a beautiful athmosphere, caracteristicly decorated, and felt clean and safe. We are happy to recomend this place to family and friends that will visit Rome."

Wer empfindlich fÃ¼r LÃ¤rm ist, sollt hier nicht wohnen, denn es war doch einige male relativ laut nachts, von der Gasse her.
Die Wohnung ist mit Ã¶ffentlichem Verkehr und anschliessendem Fussweg (15 Min) erreichbar.
"
22930,38839604,2015-07-19,17906718,Hannah,"We absolutely loved our 3 night stay at Sabrina's apartment in Trastevere. The location is amazing, right in the heart of Trastevere. I took my boyfriend for his 30th and it was the perfect area for us to stay; loads of cute restaurants lining the cobbled streets, lots of bars, markets etc, it had a really nice feel to it without being too commercial like some of the other more touristy areas would have been. I'd not done too much research into Rome before booking, I based it purely on the reviews and I'm really pleased that I did. 

We walked everywhere pretty easily from the apartment. Probably about 15 mins to colosseum, 20 mins to Vatican and a bit further to Spanish steps. (Definitely recommend booking the Vatican and colosseum ahead to avoid queues and get the best price). 

The apartment is lovely and the roof terrace was amazing and so peaceful. Just what we needed in the 38 degree heat and one of the main reasons I booked this apartment. Definitely a good decision! Couldn't recommend more highly. 

Sabrina was hugely helpful in the run up to and during our stay which was much appreciated. We were greeted by Paolo when we arrived and despite our flight being delayed until 1am he was the perfect host. We felt very well looked after all weekend. They even helped organise our transfer back to the airport for us and let us use the apartment into the afternoon on our check out day. 

Shower is a little on the tight side and has a tendency to flood the bathroom floor but that's the only thing I can find fault with. Everything else was perfect and we would definitely go back. 

Thanks so much Sabrina and Paolo, we had a fantastic stay in Rome and will recommend you to everyone! "
22930,42892794,2015-08-16,34466484,Izzy,Perfect location. Good restaurants in the surrounding area and not to far from historic sites. Host was great. Apartment was nice and clean. All utilities worked.
22930,45974743,2015-09-07,34163202,Sofia,Highly recommended flat in lovely Trastevere. Perfect weekend base with lots of nearby restaurants. Decently sized flat for two people and the spacious (shared) rooftop is a great bonus.

22930,75314334,2016-05-20,6188975,Yehuda,"We had a phenomenal stay at Sabrina's apartment! The location is fantastic and the beautiful apartment is just like the pictures. We walked to the Vatican, Forum, Pantheon and more which were all within a 35 minute walk. So many great restaurants and cafes within 2 blocks. The unit is very quiet.

Sabrina is a very responsive host who had her colleague Paolo meet us and give us the keys. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
22930,86817507,2016-07-17,58291036,Tara,"Dealing with Sabrina and Paolo was very easy. The neighbourhood of Trastevere is so beautiful. You get a real taste of Roma with all the winding streets and cafes. The apartment was as described and was a perfect base for us. A little smaller than anticipated but great all the same. We were within walking distance to everything.... 15 mins to Vatican, and Circo Massimo. 25mins to Piazza Navona and 35 mins to Trevi Fountain. As we weren't flying home until later in the day, there was no problem storing our luggage either!!"
22930,90276349,2016-07-31,34220380,Amber,"Perfect location in Rome. My husband and I walked everywhere and were able to get to all the attractions on foot. The place was very clean and the air conditioning was a major bonus to come home to and sleep in after long days of walking in the summer heat. It's perfect for a couple. 
The only downside was the shower was hard to move around in and not soak the bathroom floor when washing your hair or shaving as a female. That being said I would still stay here again in a heartbeat. "

22930,94715459,2016-08-16,11924908,Leah,"The apartment is in a great area, surrounded by restaurants/bars. Only thing is that the apartment is not suitable for 2 people who do not want to sleep in the same bed. (which was the case with me and my dad) The sofa bed is not working properly and its not really comfortable.  Also the are no curtains in the living room, so if you are sleeping on the sofa bed you will be awake as soon as the sun set. Overall my experience of Rome was good, but I only would recommend the apartment for couples. It's too small and not practical enough if you want some kind of privacy. "
22930,95785490,2016-08-20,5217828,Carla,"Paolo met us as arranged and gave a quick description of the amenities and points of interest.  The room is smaller than appears in the photos, In particular the shower and kitchen which are tiny.  however the shared terrace is great and a bonus. We loved the area with great eating spots close by and proximity to points of interest, we walked everywhere. Any queries were quickly addressed by Sabrina."
22930,98295592,2016-08-30,24280939,Amanda,"We had a fantastic stay, the location is perfect for Rome close to all the lovely restaurants and bars, roof terrace is huge and beautiful on an evening or breakfast. Really nice touch with the bottle of wine on arrival and Paulo was very helpful with everything we needed. Apartment building was lovely with nice brick work and beams inside and authentic feel."
22930,102348977,2016-09-17,87877157,Pierre,Merci Ã  Paolo pour son accueil et  sa disponibilitÃ©. Appartement trÃ¨s propre et trÃ¨s bien situÃ© dans un quartier animÃ© et agrÃ©able. La terrasse collective est agrÃ©able . Un petit  reproche l appartement est beaucoup plus petit qu il ne paraÃ®t sur les photos. Mais pour deux c est suffisant.
22930,106108603,2016-10-04,81004133,Richard,Paulo was a great host. He provided a lot of really useful information and he was most helpful (e.g. printing our boarding passes for us). The location is wonderful. It is easy to walk from here to most of the major areas of Rome.
22930,111414695,2016-10-31,21350945,Wilma,"Sabrina reageerde erg snel en adequaat wat zeer prettig was. de transfer was prima geregeld. De ontvangst liep goed.
 Het appartement was prima voor twee personen, heel schoon, goede bedden. Het zag eruit zoals op de foto's en omschrijving beloofd. De locatie was in het hart van Trastevere, uitstekend en heel gezellig, alles bij de hand aan cafÃ©s en eettentjes. Centrum goed te belopen.
Paolo (contactpersoon)was goed te bereiken, vriendelijk en behulpzaam.
Verbeterpunten zijn het douchegordijn dat was een ramp, dat zou een douchescherm moeten zijn. De bank zat niet erg comfortabel en in de slaapkamer was het niet echt donker te maken vanwege het ontbreken van een overgordijn en een lantaarn buiten, Verder was het in het weekend lawaaiig maar je zit wel in hartje Rome."

Snabb och bra kommunikation med bÃ¥de Sabrina och Paolo. Allt fungerade effektivt och bra. 
Perfekt boende i Rom fÃ¶r den som vill uppleva staden pÃ¥ egen hand. "

22930,202841929,2017-10-13,4667631,Aniello,Great place - your own simple apartment in the middle of Trastevere with a shared rooftop. It was perfect for me - I'd go back there anytime.
22930,265493899,2018-05-17,111452405,David,Great location in a fantastic neighborhood. After a week we felt like a part of the community. Nice quiet terrace was a bonus. Very clean cozy flat very nicely renovated. 5 stars!

The rooftop terrace is a definite perk - make sure to enjoy it! If you are looking a true Roman experience, close enough to walk to the center and yet a place tucked far enough away from the traffic in the lovely heart of Trastevere, I recommend staying at Sabrina's place.

22930,529861521,2019-09-15,5369438,Peter,Sabrina's was a great stay. Check-in and communication was quick and easy and the location is great - right in Trastevere but just off to the side where it is more quiet. Trastevere gets very noisy at night but this place is quieter. The roof terrace is great too.

22930,607638842,2020-02-18,34215816,Carole,"Sabrinaâs place is really clean and cosy, perfect for a long lovers weekend in Roma.
It is part of an old building with character (visible stones and wood beams), totally renovated.
The flat 3 is white and blue painted, the decoration is minimalist but tasteful and effective.
It is perfectly located in Trastevere meaning it is very close to restaurants / bars while just far enough in a narrow perpendicular street to sleep in a quite place.
The flat is big benough for 2 (but not for 3). The bedroom is comfy and the kitchen is well equiped. Bathroom might be found a bit tiny.
Sabrina is nice and reactive for the booking and check-in / check-out is on time,  welcome is very warm with Paolo.
The terrace is amazing with  wide view, lounge chairs and table. Even if shared with other flats, it is large enough for everybody to enjoy.
I warmly recommend this place.

25875,100614,2010-09-19,207222,Bianca,"Giovanna was an excellent host! She constantly made sure that we were comfortable and patiently answered all our questions regarding the city.

She was gracious enough to allow us an early check-in and a late check-out. The apartment was very clean and spacious. It was very well-maintained. 

The apartment is a few minutes walk to the Vatican and very near the grocery (Carrefour). It is very close to the bus stop which takes you directly to the main train station (Roma Termini) and drops you off near the tourist attractions. Most importantly, the buses pass by frequently.

I would most definitely stay here again :-)"
25875,3214847,2013-01-02,1844019,Jan,"Great location, loads of activities! "
25875,5432389,2013-06-30,6207321,Ylva,"The apartment is located on the eastern side of the street, just a few hundred meters south of the Vatican city. Along the street there is a lot of pizzerias, icecream bars and a very nice bakery (for the morning bread) as a neighbour in the street. Yes, there is a lot of traffic daytime, but not at all unbearable, and it is less in the night. Also the jalousie takes away some of the sound, and at the samt time makes it dark in the bedrooms. We had no problem to sleep, and it was cool and nice even without AC (in june). The kitchen is perfect for a small family, easy to use. There is a partly sunny balcony with 4 chairs, perfect to use in the night when the children are asleep and you want to enjoy the mild climate, but don't want to leave the apartment. Unfortunatelly a big tree is taking away most of the view, but at the same time makes the balcony lush. The other balcony is outside the kitchen, our small children liked to be there in the mornings, in the shade. The apartment has white stone/marble floor in all rooms, feels really nice! The washingmachine made it easy to clean our small childrens shirts, perfect!
We wanted to walk to the centre of Rome and Trastevere, but it was really hard to walk southeastwards, due to the road (no sidewalk in the southern parts), and also there is a big hill/ridge between the street and the river. We didn't know that when we arrived, but we walked north to St Peters and then eastwards to reach the centre of Rome. It was ok and only took like 15-20 minutes. We only took the bus the last day, to the station.
It is a really nice apartment, and our children refered to it as ""the hotel"". We didn't meet Giovanna personally, but her nice and serviceminded son met us when we arrived. He fixed the tv the first night, and Giovanna sent some extra glasses with a maid when we asked for it. 
I recommend this apartment, we were 6 persons and it was perfect in size for us, even if the table in the kitchen is more suited for 4 (we didn't eat breakfast at the same time, so it was ok for 6 as well...)."

It is a nice, large apartment located very close to St. Peter's Basilica. There is a bakery a few steps away and a supermarket near by.

The flat is well equipped. We found all the things we needed, and everything worked. 

Giovanna was very helpful during our stay, and she answered our emails quickly while we arranged the trip.

I can definitely recommend the place.

25875,8316796,2013-10-25,9013777,Anita,"Goed appartement vlakbij Vaticaanstad, dus een perfecte ligging voor een bezoek aan Rome. Bus stopt in de straat, supermarkt, bakker en diverse restaurantjes en winkeltjes op loopafstand.
Er is wel veel lawaai vanaf de straat, maar ja het is ook midden in Rome.
Inrichting appartement voldoende, alles aanwezig.
Jammer, geen zon in het appartement of op het balkon, dus binnen een beetje somber.
Eigenaresse erg vriendelijk."
25875,9653298,2014-01-04,10413569,Maria,"We had a lovely stay at Giovanna's apartment near St. Peter's Square during our weeklong visit to Rome over the holidays.  First of all, it was great to arrive at the airport and have someone meet us to take us straight to the apartment.  Giovanna had arranged a taxi service to pick us up as we requested.  The apartment was as presented online and it suited us well.  The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen and bathroom were well equipped.  It was also important for us to have a washer in the apartment.  The internet worked very well.  Giovanna was very kind and took care of any concerns we had about the heating right away.  We were given fresh towels midweek which was great.  And we were pleasantly surprised on New Year's Eve with a gift of sparkling wine and panettone!  

Because the apartment is so close to the Vatican we were able to make several trips to see St. Peter's and the museum. We even heard the Pope speak from a window on Sunday at noon.  The apartment is close to a stop for Bus 64 which takes you straight into the heart of Rome.  There are also a grocery shop, a bakery and many restaurants nearby.  We really enjoyed the Chinese restaurant Yu Qui Ling.  Giovanna gave us some good restaurant recommendations and Osteria dei Pontefici served us the best meal we had during our stay in Rome.  

All in all we left very happy with our stay in Giovanna's apartment and with our visit to the Eternal City. We hope to return someday!"
25875,12076313,2014-04-22,8165906,Nancy,"Giovanna was the perfect host.  Professional, punctual, friendly, sincere, helpful, and generous.  Her apartment near St. Peter Square was an awesome, safe location for exploring Rome.  Steps from the Square, the Basilica, and very close to the Vatican Museum.  We saw all the main sights of ancient Rome on foot.  Central bus runs right outside apartment, but we never took it, preferring to walk each of three days in Rome.  The apartment was absolutely spotless and huge in an older city building of just a handful of apartments.  Two very large bedrooms for the 5 adults in our party to spread out, plus a huge living room, foyer, and eat-in kitchen, fully equipped.  Large bathroom with excellent fixtures. Wifi, perfect!  Giovanna offered advice before and when we arrived.  Thank you Giovanna for your meticulous care of this wonderful space.  And thanks for the Easter cake!  What a nice touch!  Sincerely,  Nancy  "
25875,13146133,2014-05-20,12105605,RocÃ­o,"The apartment of Giovanna was really nice. Beds were comfortable and we had everything we needed. The neighbourhood was good, it has a few restaurants and cafeterias nearby and a carrefour market, so you can buy everything you could need. As Giovanna says in the announcement, he place it's really close to the Vatican, you can even see the dome from the balcony.  

In addition Giovanna was so helpful and nice, she answered quickly the emails and replied every question we had. 

I recommend the apartment, it's not so close to the very center of Rome but you have a bus at the same street that goes directly to every touristic place. You can go even walking (we did and it's very nice, because you discover beautiful places of Rome on the go).  I would stay again here. "
25875,14577841,2014-06-22,16540866,Carl,"Giovanna was a very good host, friendly and helpful.  The apartment was ready for check in early which was much appreciated after an overnight flight. She gave us good neighborhood recommendations on restaurants and sights. The rooms were large, clean and comfortable as advertised.  The train station was just a few blocks away and St Peters square was an easy eight minute walk. Giovanna  lives in the same building and was available for questions and advice but never intrusive. We had a lovely stay and can highly recommend the accommodations "
25875,14774422,2014-06-26,13854306,Stephanie,"Giovanna was a very responsive host.  She communicated well in email and while we did not get a chance to meet her in person, everything went very smoothly.  The apartment is very nice and well set up for a family of four.  The kitchen had everything we needed and the terrace was a nice place to place to relax in the evenings.  The location was convenient to St. Peters and also a train station.  I loved the numerous food shops nearby that made it very easy to find food to fix in the apartment.  I would stay here again."
25875,15115025,2014-07-02,14263735,Kenneth,"Our experience was very positive. The apartment was very clean, and matched the pictures on the website. The location was excellent . . . literally a 6-7 minute walk to St. Peter's Square, and a 5 minute walk to the bus stop (to the Coliseum, Roman Forum, Borghese Gallery, Pantheon etc.). The apartment is in a neighborhood which is exactly what we wanted. We felt very safe in the area. There is a grocery store on the same street a few blocks up (closes promptly at 8pm), and many smaller markets, cafes, restaurants and a bakery a few steps outside the front door! The rooms were large and all basics were provided (bedding, towels, toilet paper, paper towels). The kitchen was adequate and provided all we needed to cook simple meals. Giovanna even supplies recipes! There was also a hair dryer, iron and ironing board which came in handy. The washing machine was small, but adequate. Apparently dryers are not common! There is a large drying rack on the balcony off the kitchen which was private and served us well. There were outlet converters provided, but we had brought two of our own which seemed to work better with curling irons and straighteners. Not sure why, but the converters provided tripped the circuit breaker with certain appliances. Our laptop worked fine with the provided converter. The shower is small, and hot water runs out quickly if you are not paying attention. After the first round of showers it was never a problem for us! There is another small balcony off the front bedroom with an ice cream parlor style table and 4 chairs which was where we enjoyed our morning coffee. Wifi was included. It did not work for a day and a half . . . not sure why, but the second day when we got back to the room, it worked fine and did not impact our stay in any way. We decided to pay extra for air conditioning. We only needed to turn on 2 of the 3 air conditioners at night, and even then, our daughters turned off the one in their room because they didn't need it. We never ran them during the day . . . mainly because we weren't there, and at night when we turned them on, they cooled the rooms so quickly. We felt having the option was well worth the expense. Giovanna was gracious and quite helpful. She responded promptly to our questions. She referred us to a car service for airport pick up and drop off. That company was on time and the van was new, clean and cool. (Many taxis do not use air conditioning. This car service did.) I would absolutely stay here again. If you are looking for the luxurious hotel experience, this may not be for you. If you are looking for the experience of being in a real Italian neighborhood, this is the place!! For our family, it was definitely worth the trade off...."
25875,21315958,2014-10-14,10813481,Mary,"Giovanna was very open with her communication so we knew what to expect when we arrived and were given options on how to get to the apartment from the airport.  She took the time to show us around the apartment and make us feel welcome.  The apartment itself is very spacious, secure and had nearly everything we needed (however we did not think to ask for a toaster).  The main bedroom is very quiet however the second bedroom might be a bit noisy for light sleepers.  The location is good for the Vatican etc and the 64 bus is great for getting into the historic centre where most of the other tourist spots are.  There are numerous bars and restaurants in the vicinity for eating out and the supermarket is just a 5 min walk away.  This is a homely place to stay, certainly not in the luxury category but well located."
25875,21595897,2014-10-20,21220168,Eero,"A great location to explore Rome and the Vatican. Nice, clean rooms. Lots of restaurants and cafes around. Helpful and friendly service. Traffic noise was a bit loud."
25875,33456120,2015-05-28,15194014,Asgeir,"Great flat at a great location with just a few minutes walk to St. Peters. If you do not fancy to walk to the center of Rome (20 - 30 minutes), there is a bust stop close to the flat. Giovanna was a great host, responded quickly to our questions and gave us directions as to where to eat and which bus to get downtown. Carrefour is nearby and many good restaurants where locals like to dine. Highly recommended."
25875,35037856,2015-06-14,22618091,Lainie,"The location was so perfect! A 5-10 minute walk from St. Peter's square. The apartment is so spacious, too. We didn't have any noise problems from the busy street outside--and as a group of female students, we were thankful for the lively street! Giovanna let us drop off our stuff before check in and leave it the day we left! Keep in mind the additional costs listed, but they were well worth it. We can't thank Giovanna enough!"
25875,39385848,2015-07-23,14252377,Kimberly,"My husband and I, along with my parents, all stayed here together and it was fabulous! Great communication and professionalism by the host and it turned out to be a wonderful location. We were close enough to St. Peter's to enjoy being connected to the city, but far enough to feel some peace and quite when we wanted to sit back and relax! "
25875,44292757,2015-08-25,23136966,Irene,"Very well connected to the train station and the old town by bus that runs 24h. Quiet area and comfy beds, that's all you need to have in Rome, we only went there to sleep!
We talked with Giovanna on the phone and she was very polite and wanted to make sure everything was okay. She is available for whatever inconvenience it may occur. We were lucky and nothing happened, of course :-)"
25875,48295301,2015-09-25,41189827,Tine,"VÃ¦rten Giovanna har hele vejen igennem vÃ¦ret sÃ¸d oplysende og meget hurtig til at svare mails, med hjÃ¦lp og gode tips bl.a om transport til og fra lufthavn.
Lejligheden lever til fulde op til billederne. Der er god plads med to velfungerende og store sovevÃ¦relser, stue og spisekÃ¸kken.
Stilen er ikke personlig men lidt tÃ¸r og kedelig, men der er det der skal vÃ¦re og der mangler ikke noget.
Der fÃ¸lger ogsÃ¥ 2 altaner med, hvor jeg havde glÃ¦det mig til at sidde, men den ene er mÃ¸rk og tillukket mod gÃ¥rden, og den anden ligger ud til gaden som er ret trafikeret og larmende.
Lejligheden ligger med Peters Pladsen som nabo og er dermed perfekt hvis det er det omrÃ¥de man vil udforske. Der gÃ¥r bus lige udenfor dÃ¸ren og billet kÃ¸bes i en lille bar i nÃ¦rheden og kÃ¸rer direkte mod byen. Fra Travestere fandt vi aldrig ud af offentlig transport hjem og gÃ¥turen derfra er lang efter en hel dag pÃ¥ benene. Lejligheden ligger ikke i centrum og i et lidt kedeligt omrÃ¥de, men pÃ¥ den anden side fÃ¥r man meget lejlighed for pengene.
Som andre har skrevet er der en del larm fra trappen og dÃ¸ren der smÃ¦kker ud til gaden i det vÃ¦relse uden altan. VÃ¦rtinden har for nylig isat ekstra lydtÃ¦tte vinduer, da der generelt er meget larm fra gaden og ogsÃ¥ noget stÃ¸jende renovation om natten og det hjÃ¦lper meget, men det er derfor svÃ¦rt at have vinduerne Ã¥bne om natten.
Jeg havde intet imod at bo der igen, men ville forsÃ¸ge at finde noget tÃ¦ttere pÃ¥ centrum hvis jeg var villig til at betale mere. Men jeg er ogsÃ¥ typen der mest af alt nyder at vandre rundt i centrums gaderne i timevis og er man fÃ¸rst kommet tilbage til lejligheden er det svÃ¦rt at tage sig sammen til at tage retur igen eks. for at spise middag."
25875,51208057,2015-10-18,45938419,Karen,"Giovanna met us on our arrival and showed us around the apartment, explaining all the services available in the local area.  She responded promptly and answered all our queries.

The apartment is lovely- just as described. A supermarket is open 24/7 just up the road; bus # 64 to Rome's most important sights goes right past the door; beds are comfortable; fast wi-fi; laundry facilities; and a fully equipped kitchen for the nights when we didn't want to eat out!

The apartment is in a prime neighbourhood.  Well positioned for tourists and a nice quiet area."
25875,52350063,2015-10-28,46104081,Jillian,We enjoyed our stay in this very roomie apartment. It had all the things we needed to cook and relax with our two children after days off exploring Rome. There is a 24hr grocery store just up the street which was very helpful. There are some nice places to eat just down the street and taxis and buses just down the street to take you where you need to go. Giovanna was very helpful with answering any questions we had in a nice timely manner. Great stay and would stay again int he future.
25875,53698766,2015-11-11,38731793,Kalina,We were amazed that after 5min walk from St Peters square we already get to Giovanna's flat. Beautiful marble corridor left us breathless. Flat is spacious and for 5 professional women was more than enough. The Vatican view from window and comfy living room. Giovanna and her son were very helpful. Thank you for making our visit perfect :)
25875,58195915,2016-01-01,43786806,Tiina,"Giovanna was a very reliable and friendly host, who met us upon arrival and kindly explained the main things about apartment and the surroundings. The apartment is very spacious and practical for our family. The area and the house itself was nice and felt safe. It was very easy to walk to St. Peters and there was also a frequent bus (which was always very crowded!) nearby whenever we needed to go further downtown. The only drawback was that the kitchen was pretty chilly now in the middle of winter, but it did not bother us too much. We could definitely stay her again, if we come back to Rome!"
25875,100093025,2016-09-07,235722,Charlie,"when you want a place near the vatican, this apartment is perfect. just a short walk to st. peters basilica and a 24 hours grocery on your left. the apartment is very clean ang spacious. it has all the amenities you need. only problem is you cannot use all the appliances at the same time because the power will shut off. The host Giovanna was very nice in welcoming us and she will always reply to us immediately if we have questions."

This apartment is very close to Vatican City and it was very easy getting around with the 64 bus. "
25875,160016093,2017-06-12,115593685,Martin,"We loved our stay in Giovanna's beautiful apartment. It was perfectly clean, light and beautifully furnished. Giovanna was a kind and welcoming host, who took the time to show us the apartment and advise us about sightseeing in Rome. The apartment was an easy walk to St Peter's Square and the San Pietro railway station, and was right on the handy No.64 bus route. There were multiple food shops and restaurants all the way along the street. We would happily stay there again. "

He was very helpful in getting us set up and giving us information on places to eat, things to see etc. The apartment, though a little old, was very spacious and comfortable for our family of 4 adults. "
25875,222972414,2017-12-31,162149654,David,"We just finished 3+ days in Rome.  Giovanna is a great hostess with many helpful tips and suggestions for things to do in the city.  The apartment is just a couple hundred yards from St. Peter's square and an easy bus or taxi ride from the rest of Rome's attractions.  The apartment is on a quiet street (which was welcomed after long days out and about), but with good places to eat nearby.  Overall, we had a great stay!"

25875,275880919,2018-06-12,188203778,Jack,"This place is excellent and in a very convenient location.  It is right up the street from St. Peter's Basilica (and the Vatican of course) in a very trendy part of Rome proper.  There are nice restaurants nearby and a wonderful gelato place opened up right next door while we were there.  The Rome public transportation system is a little difficult to track at times but this space is right on the 64 bus line (watch out for pickpockets on this line, it is evidently notorious and we had a phone stolen) and a very short walk to the Roma San Pietro train station.  Very convenient for doing the whole tourist thing.  I LOVED the individual air conditioning units for each of the main rooms.  They work very well and I was able to have a nice frosty room while the older folks of the party could have a warm room!  No fighting over the AC controls."

However, the rooms are right above a bar, so it can be a little noisy at night. The room is nice, clean, and very pretty. The only thing to note is that the bathroom, while sufficient, is small. We had a private bathroom, but the bathroom is not attached. We stayed all across Europe, so I recognize that the facilities over there can be smaller, however this bathroom was very cramped. "
26957,95161,2010-09-12,178827,Karen,They were very helpful and let us check in late in the day.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  The house was quiet and very nice. The neighbourhood is wonderful as well.  For the rest of our trip we wished we could go back and stay there again!
26957,112771,2010-10-06,178390,Toby,"Callisto 6 is in a great location, is clean and a great way to stay in Rome.

It is run a little more like a small hotel than a b and b.

It is noisy outside, with a bar under our windows (on the first level above the ground floor).  Cigarette smoke and conversation drifted in late into the night, and coffee was being served early in the morning.  Not a problem if you close the windows and turn on the air conditioner, but something to note.

Overall, a solid place to stay."

26957,5349954,2013-06-25,1997881,Eve,Andrea's place is in an amazing location and was exactly as described. Being in the heart of Rome's old town made the city even more enjoyable. Andrea was communicative and very helpful with tips on where to eat. He organised a transfer for us that all went smoothly. There is a little bit of noise below but it didn't bother us we slept with the window closed and the air con on. Definitely recommend to anyone staying in Rome. 
26957,5976294,2013-07-24,855539,Maja,"We had a wonderful time in Rome. The room in the B&B was super cute, clean, nice view on the square, with an AC,... but the location of the B&B is simply amazing. You can reach the city center on foot and walk through the nice neighborhood of Trastevere. Its streets and squares are packed with bars and at night it is fool of young people having drinks and hanging around. If you cant handle a bit of noise from the lively square, than choose another room, but the windows are new do most of the job to assure a good night sleep. Andrea was super flexible in term of check in, which was pretty great. I would recommend this place to anyone and will stay at the B&B again when I am in town."
26957,9029292,2013-12-02,9569838,Katie,"Andrea was a fantastic host, taking time to help us figure out our surroundings and recommending where to go.

We actually think the new location was better than the originally booked room - quieter location, but still in the heart of Trastevere. The room was good with its own ensuite. We had a shared kitchen with one other room, where breakfast was provided (bread, jam, yogurt, cereal, tea & coffee). We only briefly met Andrea and he was very warm and friendly. Highly recommended Airbnb."

27816,259611,2011-05-11,487884,Mirko,"I would definetly reccomend Campo de Fiory to everyone. It is especially practical and cosy for couples. Piazza Campo de Fiori on witch the appartment is located is one of the best. You can find great paninis, restaurants, gelatos itc. During the day it is home of the market place, and at the evening it becomes ocupied with entertainers of every kind...
The host is not so open for information giving, but you can go by without it...

Very well situated, this flat allows you to walk around the historic center and the main points of interest of the city within 10-20 minutes. Just perfect. The studio was clean and Cristina did her best to welcome us. Everything is ok in the studio, there's no big window, so no real daylight coming in but bascially it's ok because you can open the door on the groundfloor and have an intimate little view on the courtyard. There's also a little table + two chairs to have breakfast in the sun. Nice bakery in Via dei Baullari, just round the corner. Quite expensive for the space available inside but that's the average price to pay to be located in the heart of the Eternal city. We can recommand this place and would go back anytime ! "

27816,4568306,2013-05-13,5054208,Jenny,I think the apt is very centrally located near Campo De Fiori and walkable to the ruins which was positive. There are several downsides. The shower was horrible and did not drain and filled the floor of the tiny bathroom.  It was extremely noisy on Saturday night and I did not feel safe there.  We were there for 3 nights and I regretted staying there. The courtyard had garbage in it and is not well maintained.  Christina charged 20 euros for a cleaning fee that I wasn't aware of beforehand. All in all it was not a place I can recommend to my friends. 
27816,4648947,2013-05-18,5278224,Brooklynn,"Location, location, location!! This apartment is located in the heart of Rome's most authentic piazza. Every morning there is a street market and you can get fresh fruit, spices, and bread! The piazza is full of wonderful restaurants and bars. The apartment itself is small, but it served its purpose because we only needed a place to sleep. The shower is a bit tricky and I wouldn't suggest it for elderly travelers. If you need wifi just pop into any of the local bars (the Draft Book right across the street is cozy) and order a drink for the wifi password. There is a bus stop right around the corner, but honestly we only took that to get to the Vatican. Everything else is definitely within walking distance! We're two college aged girls who travelled alone and this piazza is definitely safe! I would definitely stay here again! Ciao!"
27816,4727832,2013-05-22,5466530,Patricia,Rita has a wonderful place for Rome lovers and her little loft has it all ! I recommend the experience and will tell all my friends about it !
27816,7949842,2013-10-09,159433,Vlad & Nat,"The location of this studio is fantastic! It is one of the more popular neighborhoods and is steps away from a great market and shopping. You can literally walk to Piazza Navona, the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain. 

UNFORTUNATELY the apartment does not look as nice in person as it does in the photos (the bathroom and walls were super moldy/mildewy) and despite the great location it was seemed over priced for the quality. Had the photos more accurately portrayed the apartment we would not have chosen to stay there. However, this would be a good place to stay at a much lower price point.  "
27816,8379110,2013-10-28,9170253,Fanny,"Vraiment un sÃ©jour trÃ¨s agrÃ©able dans un studio pittoresque et romantique situÃ© prÃ¨s d'une place superbe, vivante et en plein coeur historique de Rome. Que du bonheur ! 
Nous avons Ã©tÃ© particuliÃ¨rement bien accueilli, aucun problÃ¨me pour trouver et contacter la personne qui nous accueillait. 
A so plaisant appartment, romantic, typical and perfectly located in the center of Roma. Thank you very much. "
27816,11506138,2014-04-06,11051662,Chris,"We were very disappointed in this apartment because the outside was very dirty for there were too many cigarette buds on the common court yard.  The night before we left, we heard 2 or 3 people outside shouting, talking loud and they threw up right in front of our door.  It was gross! We had to make sure that our shoes and our luggage were not touching it.

The inside is not too bad, and it is clean.  The bed is comfortable although it is just an opened couch.  The bathroom is bad because you have to stand on a piece of wood deck to keep your feet from so much water on the floor, but it feels very awkward.  The toilet is not really stable, meaning it is not completely attached to the floor.  

There is a small stove and sink that we could cook and wash things, that is nice. 
No breakfast for the guests, and I have heard that this is not unusual.  

The location is interesting.  It has a popular open market outside their courtyard, where they sell vegetables, flowers, clothing, handbags, lots of stuff, and we enjoy looking or shopping there.   

Overall, I am sorry to say that we will not stay here again because we feel it is unsafe, has dirty courtyard, and a bad bathroom which can also be hazardous.   Maybe the owner can improve the situation."

We had a great time in Roma and in the flat.  The apartment is  small but very pleasant, tidy and clean. There are many special items in the apartment It seems that a lot of thought was invested in every detail.  Excellent location in a quiet area and a short walk to the different sites. highly recommend.
"
27816,74186308,2016-05-13,14068468,Emmanuel,"Very nice place, quiet and cosy. The welcome was friendly and we had time to talk about Roma."
27816,77066231,2016-05-30,63976742,Michael,"My wife and I visited from 20 - 30 May, 2016. The most important thing to understand about this apartment is that its location is perfect if you want to see the heart of the city and all the main tourist attractions of Rome. We were within easy walking distance of all the major sites. Termini was about a 45 minute walk for us, the Borghese gardens about 30, St. Peter's about 15, Colosseum about 20, etc. Location can't be beat.

We really only came back to the room to rest and sleep; otherwise we were out and about. It was perfectly sufficient for our needs. Cristina, with whom visitors interact (not Rita) is pleasant and communicative and agreeable (more on this below). Good service and great location. It is located in a quiet courtyard - no problem with noise or foot traffic at night.

A few things to be noted:

First, and this is minor, but the apartment is not n. 30. Just fyi when you're first trying to find it. I think it's 36 or 38. You'll notice that several photos focus on a reddish wall with a stairwell, within the courtyard - that isn't this apartment. The picture of a door with a little postbox out front is.

Second, Rita had incorrectly advertised the current city tax. I pointed this out to her upon discovering that she had done so (which was after I had paid for the apartment), and Cristina kindly covered the difference between the actual city tax and what we signed, *thinking* the tax to be on the basis of the Airbnb description. I was grateful that Rita and Cristina were flexible and understanding in this regard.

Third, there's some mold in the apartment, especially the bathroom - for someone with allergies this might not work well.

Fourth, there was no iron, as far as I could tell, although it was advertised as being present.

Fifth, the bathroom is very small, and after you shower (even if you use the little wooden board to ""block"" the water from expanding), the bathroom floor will be wet all over for the next 8 hours or so.

Overall, I'd say that if you're looking for somewhere to do much else than rest between outings, you might seek something with a bit more space. But if you're traveling on a tight budget and just looking for a home base, this is a fine candidate.

Nonostante ciÃ² Ã© situata in un cortile molto silenzioso, benchÃ© sia al centro di Roma. Cristina e Maria Rita sono state disponibilissime su tutto, anche sul metterci a disposizione un ferro da stiro che avrebbe dovuto esserci in casa (Secondo quanto indicato sul sito) ma che non c'era: Cristina mi ha detto che, qualora avessi avuto bisogno, mi avrebbe risolto velocemente il problema. 
Ci sono due cose che non mi sono piaciute: il bagno non era molto pulito e c'era pochissimo sapone shampoo ecc, non sufficiente per due persone. L'acqua calda anche non Ã¨ sufficiente ossia bisogna decidere di farsi la doccia in momenti diversi perchÃ© l'acqua calda finisce e non Ã¨ possibile farla uno dopo l'altro. Se ci si organizza cosÃ¬ perÃ² l'acqua Ã¨ sufficiente e non ci sono problemi.

Christina came and met us as soon as we arrived, she was so friendly and welcoming. She recommended lots of nice restaurants and showed us around the room. She even offered to arrange transport back to the airport for us.

It is small but completely adequate for 2 people. You barely spend time in the room, so anything larger is unnecessary!

The only issue we really had was due to the length of our stay, we were there for 5 nights it would have been nice to have our towels and bed linen changed at least once during the stay.

The bathroom is a little bit of a pain as it's essentially a wet room, and the hot water doesn't last very long. 

All in all, a very nice stay! Thanks for having us :) "

Grab breakfast at Forno in Campo de Fiori, buy dinner supplies at the Coop supermarket a few minutes walk away, and enjoy espresso at Rome's finest: Sant'Eusatchio! The bed in this apartment was more comfortable than we could have expected (we slept really well!), and although the space is small, it is well used and laid out and you really have everything you need. The only negative thing about the apartment was the lack of internet - we were told twice upon arrival that there was no wifi, which we felt was very strange considering that it's almost 2017 and internet is essentially a necessity in our world today - and of course, we had internet everywhere else we stayed while in Europe. Internet can be found at various restaurants and cafes around the city if you need to connect, but it's good to keep this in mind if you are expecting or needing wifi during your stay. Overall, I would highly recommend staying here!"

Quelle belle ville et quelle super opportunitÃ© de logement "
27816,155923308,2017-05-29,123782708,Ãngel Jorge,"PaguÃ© una tasa adicional a la encargada, de 14 euros que no tuve en claro al principio ya que en otras ciudades no me la reclamaron. AdemÃ¡s, no tiene wifi. Pero la ubicaciÃ³n es excelente y el lugar confortable aunque un poco chico, incluyendo que es un tanto incÃ³modo para la ducha. Si se va por pocos dÃ­as y se estÃ¡ mucho en la calle, estÃ¡ bien."
27816,156871239,2017-06-01,128520908,Olivia,"Love love loved this studio, it was smaller than I expected but perfect for the 2 of us. Our flight was delayed by 5 hours and we had no internet so communication was difficult for check in but Christina was so patient and helpful. Fantastic street with a great bar (draft book) and some great shops. So close to vatican city and walking distance for some fantastic sights, cafes and restaurants. Thank you "
27816,157521355,2017-06-04,60008194,Jonathan,Cannot express how perfect the location is. Right next to Campo d' fiori with tons of great restaurants and shops! The apt. Is kept very clean with a comfortable bed and clean towels provided. It was a great stay!
27816,158800617,2017-06-08,28416354,Gina,"The bnb was quaint and nicely decorated. It's situated in a private courtyard, which was quite beautiful. I was just disappointed that there wasn't any wifi.. she said it's written in the description but somehow I overlooked this and so when I arrived I was surprised. Nevertheless, it's a cute apartment for one person or a couple."

Even in summer it was fresh and we could have a good sleep. Very central and so close to Vatican district and Trastevere also super close to via Giulia with some ancient palaces. Itâs nice to live in the center and at the same time have tranquility. 
The flat itself is very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The kitchen is especially well equipped. Thanks a lot Cristina for your welcome and for suggesting nice places around!

27816,165123522,2017-06-30,66529038,Jessica,"This apartment is a very unique and cosy one bedroom apartment, with a bathroom and kitchen included. It's in a central location that is beautiful and lively with restaurants and daily markets in the town square, just around the corner from the apartment. Talking with Rita was very easy and she gives great directions and information. "

27816,174228907,2017-07-25,124409194,Lorenzo,"L'appartamento Ã¨ esattamente come da descrizione, un monolocale piccolino ma confortevole nel cuore di Roma con tutto il necessario. La zona Ã¨ molto vivace tanto di giorno quanto di sera, ma la posizione strategica nel cortiletto privato garantisce tranquillitÃ  a qualunque ora! L'ubicazione Ã¨ davvero eccellente, in 5 giorni non abbiamo mai dovuto prendere un mezzo pubblico per raggiungere e visitare le principali attrazioni di Roma! Raccomandatissimo per chi desidera alloggiare nel pieno centro di Roma senza perÃ² rinunciare alla quiete e alla privacy! La signora Cristina Ã¨ molto accogliente e disponibile nel fornirci ragguagli circa le bellezze del quartiere ed in generale della cittÃ . Unica piccola pecca: il locale non Ã¨ molto luminoso ed areato a causa dell'assenza di finestre; tuttavia questo ""difettuccio"" Ã¨ assolutamente trascurabile vista l'ubicazione eccellente e l'ottimo rapporto qualitÃ /prezzo."
27816,178813929,2017-08-06,137954176,Michalis,"Small but lovely and cosy place. A few steps from Campo de Fiori, yet very quite. All the must see places in Rome are in walking distance.
Very good communication with host. Would go again especially for short stay"

27816,182691248,2017-08-15,138306199,Amira,"The location and setting of Primarosa Rita's place is amazing. The studio is tucked away in a gorgeous traditional cluster of homes around a courtyard. It is very quiet and off any main roads, yet very central to all Rome has to offer. 

The place is compact yet has all the facilities any single or couple needs. It was clean and everything worked. No Wifi was challenging but manageable. 

I would highly recommend staying there - I definitely would again."
27816,191418571,2017-09-07,31411550,Jelena,"Ideal for travelers on the go who plan on using it as a bedroom, the listing is perfectly located with all the important attractions a short walk away. Surrounded by nice restaurants, bars and shops, its neighborhood is very pretty and pleasant. The apartment itself is a little on the crowdy side and the no wifi doesn't exactly make things easier, but it is quite affordable and if you manage your expectations, you can have a satisfying experience while remaining on budget."

1. There was no wifi as promised for the first two days
2. They have charged us a city tax (32 EU) that was not mentioned on the site and did not give us any receipt as they promised
3. There was no hot water
4. CAMPO DE' FIORI market is 2 minutes' walk near the apartment, but there is a warehouse next door, and the loud NOISE  start EVERY MORNING at 5 AM! So we couldn't sleep that well 
5. The hostess is not available for any questions and refill of toilet paper!

Le studio est petit mais a son charme. parfait pour notre sÃ©jour.
Nous avons adorÃ© la placette de l'immeuble ! Je recommande vivement aux courts sÃ©jours et reviendrais avec plaisir."
27816,253339561,2018-04-14,39177483,Byron,"Location, location, location. The space is in the middle of all the cool stuff. It is a hip part of Rome and a cool courtyard. This place is for the early risers since work goes on at about 5 am every morning when workers are getting ready for the market."
27816,256593731,2018-04-23,31638617,Melissa,"The best possible location for us or any guest in Rome. Everything is walkable and we didn't need any transportation around the city other than to the airport. Communication was excellent and we were given useful explanations for guidance from airport. Upon arrival, we were met by the home owner, Madame Cristina who was lovely and she the left us with a couple of great Rome books and a selection of business card with her top recommendations. 

The flat is very small but you don't need any thing else as theres so much to see, do and eat out of the flat. If on a budget, I would recommend bringing over some instant coffee from home as local instant coffee is expensive. 

The hot water only lasts for about 7 minutes so it's got to be a quick dip in and out to make it last for 2. The courtyard the flat is in, is absolutely picturesque and you can sit outside with a glass of wine if you want to. The colours, architecture and greenery is stunning. The only thing is that because the courtyard is also the back of shops/restaurants, there is A LOT of noise in the night. I am a heavy sleeper but was woken up 4 times on our last night by loud neighbors perhaps closing up. But this wouldn't put me off staying here - I would just recommend ear plugs. It really is the perfect location. The river is 7 minutes away which can take you over to the Vatican in no time or over to the bohemian part Travestere. 

Thank you for having us we'll be back again :)"
27816,262217794,2018-05-08,33063033,Susan,"This place is great! Close to everything- sites and restaurants! The apartment is super cute and cozy, all you need for a stay in Rome! The only thing Iâll note was the neighbor during our stay was a bit noisy in the early hours. It was a great place to stay I canât recommend it enough!!"
27816,264111147,2018-05-13,7352536,Samir,"The location is just perfect to discover Rome and it is hidden in a little gem of a courtyard.
Unfortunately check in was not smooth and I wasted one afternoon because of wrong numbers and missing contact of the person who would actually come.
The place is small, not comfortable but definitely OK if you donât need fancy things.
The things that bothered me are the noise (market preparation start before 6am!), the absence of actual windows, and the WiFi which is just a 4g router with bad reception (the fix is to have an external battery to be able to move the router outside).
The best thing was the price. I would say that overall this place has a ok value for money in this expensive city."
27816,265162477,2018-05-16,71399971,Sheri,We had a great stay here.  The location is perfect!  There is so much to do with in a few minutes walk from the apartment.  So glad we stayed here!

Attention juste Ã  la douche, l'eau chaude ne dure que 8 minute environ. Great place to stay, right in the centre of rome."
27816,269822122,2018-05-28,84682074,Victoria,"Our staying at Madame Cristinaâs apartment was wonderful! Very nice location! If you stay here you can reach the most valuable sightseeingâs by feet) The apartment has a really fantastic atmosphere!  It is situated on the ground flour and it is very worthwhile after long Rome trip   - you donât have to use stairs!!! A lot of tourists like to came to this little area inside the building and make a photo, but totally it is a very safe place: âgardenâ could be locked by key) As a previous comment mentioned, there is a small mines - sound of garage doors with rollets next to the flat (in early morning) which is a little bit loud and annoying , but when your are exhausted with a long interesting day it is very quickly to fall a sleep again. So, it was not the big mines for us! Also, you can drink water from the tap and from various fountains which are near apartment!  Madame Cristina is a very kind and friendly lady! She has a lot of advice for you! Also, she can be reached by Whats App, so you shouldnât buy âvoiceâ cell-package , internet is enough."
27816,273140072,2018-06-05,22748280,Joanna,"Great stay al lovely apartment. Place is very cute and perfect for 2 people to share. Best thing about it is location as as soon as you step out of theittle square where it is,you are in the center of Old Rome and it makes it a perfect destination if you want to walk everywhere. The only but that I have is that next door there is fruit dispensor and it is loud there from around 8 am and it doesnt stop so I was waken up by it every day. Overall great experience and I have already recommended it to my friend to stay:)"

la casa Ã¨ in una splendida corte, unica nota dolente che al mattino presto si sentono un pÃ² di rumori."
27816,432957076,2019-04-05,76175471,Eric,I would definitively recommend staying here. The place is central to alot of sights in Rome. There are many restaurants and markets near by. There is alot of places to enjoy the nightlife near by also. The place is spacious and boasts special touches. The host is very nice and knowledgeable about the area. The neighborhood is historic and picturesque. I would definitely stay here again.
27816,435033806,2019-04-09,89147953,Sandrine,Appartement idÃ©alement placÃ© au coeur de Rome pour un court sÃ©jour. Logement petit et peu lumineux mais fonctionnel. Toute la partie historique est accessible Ã  pieds.
27816,439545880,2019-04-19,231636017,Pierrick,"Un trÃ¨s bon accueil lors de notre sÃ©jour qui sâest trÃ¨s bien passÃ©. 
La cour est charmante, dommage pour le bruit tÃ´t le matin du rideau de fer du voisin, Ã  partir de 5h et Ã  rÃ©pÃ©tition au grÃ© des ventes du marchÃ©.
Le logement est trÃ¨s bien situÃ© pour visiter la ville historique SI BELLISIMA!
Les restaurants aux alentours sont excellents.
Les soirÃ©es animÃ©es.
Un autre bÃ©mol, la durÃ©e de la douche chaude. A 2 il ne faut vraiment pas traÃ®ner... moins de 10 minutes largement!
Cela mis Ã  part,  je recommanderai vivement ce lieu (oÃ¹ nous avons pris beaucoup de plaisir) pour un couple ou une personne seule de moins de la cinquantaine.
Nous y retournerons peut-Ãªtre, car nous avons jetÃ© une piÃ¨ce Ã  la fontaine de TrÃ©vi. "
27816,442685390,2019-04-24,19130108,Luca,"The place is very central, though in a quiet area, just round the corner pf the turistic flow.  The only drawback is the noise in the early morning, from people using the garage next door. 
The apartment is small but cute, and comfortable . The owner has been very nice in welcoming us, and gave  us good advices on restaurants! Good value."
27816,444797800,2019-04-28,30669357,Melissa,"The location of Ritaâs place is amazing- you are essentially right at Campo Di Fiori, which is a great area to be around since there are daytime markets and nighttime restaurants and activity. The house was artfully decorated and had exactly what we needed- a cozy place to sleep, shower, and have a drink and relax in between our busy schedule exploring Rome. The WiFi is a little spotty and if you want to sleep in youâll have a little bit of trouble since the adjacent businesses start up around 7-8am, but if you are focused on exploring Rome and being in the heart of the experience, this is a great place to stay. Rita and Cristina were actively communicative, welcoming and gave us great tips for places to eat and explore in the area. We would definitely stay here again on a trip back to Rome!"
27816,454363940,2019-05-18,60823633,Patrick,"Excellent location! Centrally located and walking distance to all the major landmarks in the city. Thereâs a great outdoor market just down the street and a ton of restaurants and cafes nearby. 
The apartment was comfy and stylish, and had all the amenities we needed. We slept very well in the bed. 
As some people mentioned, there is a garage adjacent to the apartment that a farmerâs market vendor uses for storage and goes in and out of a few times in the morning. We had no problems going back to sleep afterwards. You canât expect to have the convenience of staying in the city center and not also hear the sounds of the city. 
Overall, it was a fantastic value if youâd like to be able to walk everywhere in Rome. We would gladly stay here again next time weâre in town."
27816,456750866,2019-05-22,132824095,Sarah,Emplacement parfait pour une visite de Rome Ã  pieds !
27816,459313551,2019-05-27,54187054,Mauro,"The stay was in general very nice.
The location is amazing: inside an ancient yard in the center of Rome, right next to Piazza Campo de' Fiori, quiet and green.
M.Rita and Cristina were very nice and replied fast whenever I needed to contact them.

Only downsides were:
1. The fee of 20â¬ for arriving at the check-in after 20.30, although it's clearly written in the House Rules (I had some problems with my flight)
2. The flat is located next to the storage room of a fruit merchant, and the workers can be loud opening and closing the shutter in the early morning (5am). But of course the house owner can't be blamed for it."
27816,460368584,2019-05-29,101884220,Claire,"Christina's apartment is right off of the Camp de' Fioriâit's in a perfect spot to explore Rome. The place itself looks just like it does in the pictures. It's a small ground-level studio in a picturesque courtyard. The apartment is very little so we didn't spend much time there, but thoroughly enjoyed the location. The bed was comfortable and Christina gave us some great local tips. It's a great choice if can forego space but still want a central location."
27816,461864096,2019-06-01,236210302,Taryn,"Most importantly, the location of this place is amazing! It is walking distance to all of the tourist attractions we wanted to visit in Rome and there are plenty of good restaurants and cafes near by. The apartment also had all of the amenities we needed for our short stay here. As others have mentioned, the garage next door is really loud in the mornings but we didnât mind too much. The owner, Cristina, gave us helpful tips and was very friendly and understanding. 

We did have a slight issue with checking in when our flight was delayed for 3 and a half hours. We had notified Rita over air bnb and kept her updated on the delay but I guess she didnât get the notifications so unfortunately Cristina was at the apartment waiting for us. We then received a message from Rita once we landed saying we are disrespectful for making her wait and should have chosen to stay at a hotel that has a 24hr porter available instead. This was confusing to us as we had no idea she didnât get our messages and it made us feel stressed and unwelcome staying here. Rita apologized the next day and told us she didnât get the notifications and Cristina was always very pleasant. Aside from our arrival, we had a really nice stay."

27816,478080728,2019-06-29,267050882,Komal,"Lovely apartment, safe neighborhood and close to some of the sights. Helpful property manager who gives insider tips on places to eat and trains. Host is great with communication. If going in summer, it gets hot and there a little fan to help but if you are used to cool, it might not help as much. Hot water runs out fast (Atleast it did with us) so I would suggest turning off shower during shampoo etc which does help saving water too. bring toiletries."

27816,528022347,2019-09-12,39398297,Nastaran,This place was quite small but in a beautiful location center to everything. The WiFi is almost non-existent and there was construction outside of the place during our stay that would start around 5:00am. If location is the most important thing to you then this place is great but if comfort and a good nights rest is more important Iâd suggest reconsidering.
27816,529908997,2019-09-15,109291803,Reika,"The location was great. Just a min walk from Campo di Fiori square. I really loved the street where the studio is â loads of cute shops! 
 
The owner Madame Cristina welcomed us for our checkin and she was so nice. 

But thereâre two problems-1. Wifi 2.Shower. We couldnât connect to any internet in the flat and hot water suddenly stopped running during the night.

However generally I can recommend the flat. Good for short stay in Rome."

Por otro lado, debes baÃ±arte un tanto rÃ¡pido (si eres mujer y tienes pelo largo) ya que el agua caliente dura poco. El resto excelente! Muy conformes, el depto cÃ³modo y muy bien equipado"

The appartment is located on a small place and except on sunday, at 5 am until 7 am, workers of the market,  are making so much noise by pushing trolleys, so the location is not appropriate to sleep after 5am..."

Probably the worst Airbnb Iâve been to. Make sure you read the fine print as there is an additional charge that is not included in the overall price. The WiFi doesnât work. The common areas are mouldy as well as the bathroom which is always wet, there is no way to dispense the water or use the toilet without getting your feet wet, itâs ridiculous. In general the apartment is very dark, there is a small window that is blocked by additional housing next to it. It is also very moist and humid as the air flow is minimal. The hub in the kitchen doesnât work. The bed is quite small, if youâre not a couple, I wouldnât suggest it. The flat sits in a courtyard with a few other shops. At around 4:00-6:00 am there is a lot of really noisy trolleys going back and forth on the uneven pavement. It was genuinely very hard to sleep. It was also cold at night, there was an additional blanket but no covers were provided... we spent there 5 days, at no point did Cristina think of offering us a change of towels, soap (there wasnât any for the shower to begin with) or toilet paper. We also asked for an additional key, she said she would leave it for us and she didnât. We really didnât enjoy the stay, it was quite horrible and even felt unhealthy because of the bathroom hygiene and difficult sleeping. The location is great otherwise I recommend avoiding."
27816,590314190,2020-01-08,100078307,Ivan,"Very nice studio, perfect location in Rome. The Campo dei Fiori is our favorite corner of Rome, convenient in every way. I highly recommend it if the owners find a way to make  Wi-Fi work properly in the room."
28929,8478570,2013-11-02,5888249,Gertraud,"For our family celebration, the apartment was just perfect. The living and dining area are very spacious and allowed us to spend time together, not just those of us who slept in the apartment, but also other family members who had rooms elsewhere. Everything was very clean and exactly as described on the website, size, beds, and environment, only the art on the walls was even less refined than in the photos. This is a little sad given the incredible art treasures in the city of Rome. The kitchen is equipped with all the basics, but a few nicer dishes would be appreciated, especially since one sees all the host's beautiful glass- and tableware in the locked cabinets. 
The location of the apartment is wonderful, close to the top of the hill and next to a park. There is little street noise, one hears only the sounds from the neighbors above and below due to the construction of these type of buildings with uncarpeted stone floors. 
On a final note, the apartment is probably owned by Aldo, but all interactions after the reservation are with a professional agency called Belvedere. Apparently that is how it works in some big cities now, the agencies use AirBnB for advertisement. The staff member who took care of us was very competent and friendly, but the agency was not quite familiar with all AirBnB procedures yet, e.g., they wanted to collect a security deposit in cash, whereas AirBnB puts a hold on the credit card, but the issue was easily clarified. Overall, we can only recommend the apartment to travelers who need beds for 6 people."

Tardaba mucho en calentar el agua. El servicio de WIFI funciona, pero es muy lento. Cobran un seguro de 300 euros por (Hidden by Airbnb) . Si no podes pagar por ese medio, debes hacerlo en efectivo y si el check out es un dÃ­a domingo, te cobran 15 euros para ir a devolverte el dinero. No posee lavavajillas ni lavarropas. Si bien se encuentra en TrastÃ©vere, es una zona muy residencial y sobre una ""colina"". Alejado de la zona de restaurantes, para hacer el camino mas corto hay que subir muchas escaleras, muy largas y cansadoras, sobretodo si estas con coche de bebe. Pagamos la cuna y nos dieron la cuna y la silla de bebe, un punto a mejorar, seria que le pongan un colchÃ³n a la cuna. "

Unfortunately there were several things not operational when we stayed. The main thing that effected us was the second shower not being usable- there were 5 of us, so this would have been great. We arrived late in the evening but paid the extra â¬25 for late check in and paid for the welcome kit also- pasta, water, juice, condiments, coffee, toasts etc -great service to offer- thank you.
We have been touring Italy for almost 3 weeks and this is the only place we have had to pay a bond - this wasn't great when the property wasn't fully operational. This property is nice and handy to bus services and it is nice to escape the hustle of central city. Thank you

Cover on couch is torn. It was more comfortable to sit on floor than couches and chairs. Electrical outlet does not work and cover comes off and is unsafe, exposing electrical wires. Detailed instructions are given for what to do when electrical fuses are blown and breakers need to be reset. Water  heater does not accommodate five showers and we were told not to use bath tub due to small water tank. We were given instructions to stagger over time a succession of showers to allow small water heater to reheat. Toilet is slow and does not flush properly.  Bathtubs are dirty worn and old. No towels for eight days.  It is unacceptable to expect to use one towel over an 8 day period. Gas stove is unsafe as knob has to be turned and gas hand lit. Even Chris could not light stove. Toilet paper for 8 days was not provided. One of keys was a copy and does not lock door properly.  It has to be jiggled.  Only two sets of keys were provided. We were a party of five.  Artwork was offensive- dog in naked womanâs crotch.  We have high tolerance but the artwork is offensive.    
We have used Airbnb on multiple occasions and this Apartment was below standards. It needs to be completely refurnished, the electrical fixed and the gas stove upgraded to safety standards.  Due to safety issues we immediately left."

Pino, inoltre, Ã¨ attento e disponibile per ogni tipo di informazione e consiglio. Lo terrÃ² sicuramente in considerazione per i miei prossimi viaggi a Roma!"
29606,20540165,2014-09-30,19319868,John,"Pino is a cool guy. We decided very spontanuous to be his guests and we had luck that the flat was free. He had a bottle of wine and some Pasta for us. That was nice, even we didn't drink the wie since my wife is pregnant and we were too tired to cook in the evening.
The flat was very clean and as described. 
The only think was missing was the parking ON the ground where the flat is. That was a slight misunderstanding. AirBnB has different translation for this option in English, Deutsch and Italiano. But Pino solved this little Problem by saving a parking directly in front of the house. 
Pino also prepared some maps of his area and of Rome. 
With two busses in the area you can reach the most important sights. 
I would not recommend to go by foot. We did and our feet were not ammused. 
You can take the bus for 1,5 â¬ or a cab for about 10 â¬. 
Pino kept contact on our stay and was always helpful. 
A really nice & trustworthy person. 
I recommend this place for a stay in Rome. 
Thanks, Pino! "
29606,21053356,2014-10-10,7720677,Roxana,"Great appartment, and Pino is the natural born host! We were warmly welcomed , then stayed in contact during our stay in case we need anything .  The location is exactly what we needed, apart from the Tourist masses, and a very nice and green neighbourhood - the bus Station is nearby, and you are in about 20 minutes in the historical Center - you can also walk to a few very very nice spots (ask Pino, he's got a lot of tipps!). Parking was no problem (the apartment doesn't have ist own private parking spot, but we found a place immediately).
The neighbourhood has everything you need (there is a Supermarket right across the street), pizzerias, a hair Salon, and not in the least smiling and friendly people. Oh, and having your coffee in the morning sunshine in the banana garden - priceless! We also appreciated the high Speed Internet and the spacious living room and bathroom- after a long day walking all over Rome, you get to come to a nice home!
Can't wait to get there again. So until next year!
Best regards and many thanks,
Roxana&Titus

29606,28760901,2015-03-29,22658146,Alireza,Pino's a very warm character. He helped us settle in and gave me a ton of information on how to get around or where to grab a good pizza. The apartment was very comfy for the 4 of us and well equipped. Pino also stayed in touch with me during our stay giving suggestions on what to see next. I would definitely recommend this place.
29606,34833527,2015-06-12,33273644,Bruno,Fomos muito bem recebidos e bem orientados por Pino. Ele nos deu toda a atenÃ§Ã£o necessÃ¡ria para uma Ã³tima estadia.
29606,34960113,2015-06-14,31767813,William,"Pino was by far the best host we have ever stayed with, he was attentive to our plans for the weekend and gave advice on where to eat, the fastest way to get to places etc.

The apartment and location are spectacular as they are quiet and within easy reach of the historical center and the best clubs. 

I highly recomend staying here!"
29606,45815069,2015-09-06,10996954,Paul,"Pino is a very nice host. We felt very welcome. He went out of his way to explain practicalities about the house, neighbourhood, public transportation, touristic sights, etc. He was very helpful en 24/7 available for any questions."
29606,48439124,2015-09-26,28065000,Fiona,"Great spot in Travestere area! Close to transit to take you where ever you may wish to go in the city! Pino was an excellent host, very accommodating , treated us to a bottle of Lambrusco and even called us a cab to take us to the train station. My girlfriend and I were very comfortable in the apartment and it could easily have accommodated another person , maybe four people total  if you don't mind sharing one bathroom .  The house was very clean and the location was wonderful , quaint neighborhood with lots of great spots to eat; however it was about a 20 minute transit ride to the Colosseum and 30 minutes to St. Peter's.  I highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Rome!  "
29606,51303213,2015-10-19,43500615,Mathias,"Pino was highly accommodating, very flexible and superlatively kind.  He provided great suggestions on what to do, and regularly checked in to make sure all was fine at all points during our holiday.  The apartment itself was great, very well furnished and not too far from the city center.  Cannot recommend this booking enough!"
29606,67275857,2016-03-27,9739753,Lucja,"Pinos Wohnung ist sehr gerÃ¤umig und man findet alles, was man braucht fÃ¼r einen schÃ¶nen Aufenthalt.
Die Nachbarschaft ist wirklich toll - das kleine Pizzabistro gegenÃ¼ber ist unschlagbar und die tÃ¼rkise Konditorei um die Ecke verkauft sÃ¼chtig machende PlÃ¤tzchen.
Die Busanbindung in die Innenstadt ist super. Sollten wir noch mal nach Rom kommen, wÃ¼rden wir gerne nochmal in Pinos Wohnung Ã¼bernachten. "

29606,75963646,2016-05-23,17749347,Ulrich,"We were very satisfied with this flat and very thankful for the great help and kindness of Pino. 
The big appartement was perfect for our days in Rome: it was more than clean (much cleaner than a hotel we believed) and well equipped and we enjoyed to have some restful nights there after our long walking tours through Rome. The kitchen-table could receive us all 6 to prepare a dinner (stove, gaz-cooker, large fridge, italian coffee-maschine, etcâ¦ a complete equipment is available). We enjoyed good warm showers and the beds were nice for a recovering sleep. We were astonished to discover a small private garden with a terrace surrounded by banana-trees and a medlar-tree which was then in the end of the month may full of yellow fruits = NÃ©flier commun (franÃ§ais) - Mespilus germanica (latin) - Mispel (deutsch). If necessary, you could have your t-shirts drying on this terrace. 
Pino welcomed us and gave us all informations needed to find our orientation in the direct neigbourhood (giving us a map of the district) and how to find the two buses (1 minute walk from the flat) and the tramwayline nÂ°8 (seven minutes walk away) which were available to join the different parts of the central part of Rome (one evening we simply used a taxi to come back to the flat and the price of the taxi-run was allright - in addition the cab driver had a small tv-screen installed in the front and Juventus Torino was just playing against Milano, can you imagine a nicer thing to drive back after and enchanting day in the streets and museums of Rome than to follow a match with the cabdriver!!! who remained concentrated on the road). We had two keys at our disposal. The flat was in a typical roman appartment building opening on a very quiet courtyard, we felt secure and well surrounded. 
The quarter around the flat had a number of shops available: a cafÃ© and bakery 15 meters away, a larger supermarket at 8 minutes distance (Simply), two fruit and vegetable shops at 5 minutes walk distance.
This flat was perfect for us and we felt lucky to stay there. We have already travelled to London and Berlin with our children, now for the first time we felt sad to leave, and we will love to meet Pino again.  "

29606,79758000,2016-06-14,53502873,Tasha,"Great Airbnb with a cute little garden outside. Good location with a giant park for running only a couple hundred metres away and quick and easy to get into the city. Place was clean and well stocked with what you'd need! Pino and his wife were very friendly and helpful if you had any questions or needed anything. Place will only come with sheets/ towels for the number of people staying, which makes sense, so make sure if you are 2 people and need two beds made that you mention that :) great place, definitely recommend!

29606,102799342,2016-09-19,83960400,Kath,"Pino is an excellent, generous and attentive host. He provides good information to help you plan your trip and make the most of your time during your visit.
The apartment is spotlessly clean and has all of the cooking, washing
,ironing and other equipment that you could possibly need. The apartment is large and airy. The accommodation is far better than in most hotels and it is good to have a home from home.
Located in a quiet area outside the main centre, with excellent transport links to Rome and Vatican City.
There are plenty of local shops and restaurants in the area if you come back in time to eat or you wish to cook at home.
In addition there is a small garden area where you can eat outside in the good weather.
"
29606,103414637,2016-09-22,69747494,Sherard,Pino met us at the airport and transported us home he gave us a good run down of what was available and where to dine and best mode of transport. Vey helpful person 
29606,103550129,2016-09-23,41835237,Rime,"Pino was a very good host and the place represents a true Romanian experience. But we had some problem with the transportation, one day we waited for 45 min for the bus and ended up walking instead to the center. But overall experience is good. I would recommend it for low budget travelers. "
29606,106805220,2016-10-08,80222240,Gaston,"Bonne description du logement.
Quartier intÃ©ressant, prÃ¨s de super marchÃ© et plusieurs petits commerces intÃ©ressants. On se sent en parfaite sÃ©curitÃ© dans ce quartier.
Merci Pino. Tout Ã©tait bien."
29606,107002001,2016-10-09,82469116,Diego,"Aunque mi estadÃ­a en Roma fue muy corta (2 noches - 3 dÃ­as), considero que  la estadÃ­a en el apartamento de Pino fue excelente, mis tres colegas y yo estuvimos muy cÃ³modos en el lugar y siempre contamos con la disposiciÃ³n de Pino para la llegada y para orientarnos en algunos lugares interesantes para conocer.  lo recomiendo al 100%"
29606,110432358,2016-10-26,40815863,Zeev,"We only spent a short while at Pino's apartment (we spent one day in Rome at the end of a long trip to Italy) - but it was a great experience.  The apartment is nice and spacious, with plenty of room for the five of us (my wife and I and our three young daughters).  It's well equipped with a kitchen containing everything you need to cook meals, a large fridge and a washing machine.  It's also quite peaceful and quiet, which was very important for us (we can't sleep in a noisy environment).

In terms of location - the apartment is very well connected to public transportation, with several different stops within a very short walking distance, linked to all the different parts of the city with short rides.  If you're coming with a car, leave it parked near the house (free) and use public transport - you don't want to take your car into Rome's center.  When you initially check in and bring your car, do try to arrive at the afternoon as finding a spot late in the evening may be difficult.

What truly stands out with this apartment is its amazing host - Pino.  Even though we arrived late, he took the time to give us countless detailed tips about Rome - many of which were new to us even though it was our 4th time in the city and helped us get the most of the short time we had to spend there.  When we bumped into a hurdle and lost a bag in Fiumicino on our way back - he was even willing to spend time to go to FCO and successfully helped us get our bag back - far above and beyond what the average host would do!

Bottom line - if you're a family and prefer staying in an apartment to staying in a hotel as we do, this is a great place for you to choose for touring Rome."
29606,124123381,2017-01-01,103234007,Ravi,"We had an awesome stay in Rome. Not only did we fall in love with the City itself, we loved our accommodation totally. Pino was very helpful and as the new year was around the corner, he welcomed us with traditional Roman new year gift. This was  a very warm gesture.

Though we reached Rome a little late in the evening, He stayed back to give us enough information on local buses and Trams and helped us plan our day in Rome. We were able to cover most places because of his suggestions. At the end of our stay, he also arranged us a Car to drop us back to the airport on a new years day. 

The house was fantastic. Very clean and at a convenient location. There are sufficient grocery stores, eateries very close to the apartment. The bus stations are also very near and walkable. Safety is not an issue at all. The place is at a very safe and comfortable location.

I will definitely  recommend this place to all those who plan to Visit Rome,  and the next time I go there, this is where I'm going to stay. Hope the place is available then."

29606,166992129,2017-07-05,111311657,Khaled,"Mr. Pino was great and helpful he was the best helpful host we got so far and the apartment in a very high security  you have a lot of keys and it is inside of a gathering buildings with an outside gate it was a great security, know to the apartment's negatives: 1- it was little bit small for a big family of 6 people 2- the small fan in the second bedroom wasn't good it couldn't cool me or my brother and sisters. so i advice any one wants to get the apartment to see the weather of the days he is going in.
i recommend any one how can handle these to issues to book in because Mr. Pino will help you and be with you all the trip."
29606,172862992,2017-07-22,13273767,Willem,"We had a great stay. The house is as discribed. It is clean and has a nice small garden. It is in a busy neighborhood, but you don't notice because the appartment is part of a small inner garden complex.
The rooms are clean and Pino left us a bottle of wine and some pasta for the first day.
The busses are around the corner and they take you within 20min to the center of the town.
So it is a good place to start your tour into Rome"
29606,173393369,2017-07-23,140809938,Annie,"We had a great time at Pino's place! Pino was very good at staying in communication with us before our arrival- none of my group had been to Rome before and Pino was on the phone texting me step by step instructions the entire journey to the apartment. The apartment was absolutely beautiful and was very clean. Pino met us there at the apartment and the gave us a map with all of the must see locations in Rome drawn out as well as a list of buses to take. Pino is an amazing Host! This is the best experience I've ever had staying at an Air B&B 

Thank you so much Pino! "
29606,177306955,2017-08-02,22257553,Caroline,Pino Waqas great. He picked us up from the airports and providing great tips of where to go and where to eat. He was attentive and extremely hospitable. The place was spacious and very clean.

29606,183042206,2017-08-16,107143947,Anurag,Pino I a great host and mantains a nice and clean apartment. He is extremely helpful and provides excellent guidance. He also helped get our luggage to us which had bee misplaced by the airline and dropped it off at the apartment at 10 pm once he had collected it. The apartment is in a safe neighborhood with good security. I would highly recommend his apartment.
29606,183741265,2017-08-18,121311386,Ashutosh,One of my favorite Airbnb experiences. Just missed air conditioning as it's an unusual summer in Rome.

Being new in Rome it was very difficult for me to figure out things in the beginning. Especially because I was traveling with my family of 7 people . 
Pino was very friendly and patient 
The room is in a very nice location with good connectivity to the center . 
The room was really clean and had all the amenities that we needed . 
I would definitely recommend this place and I would love to come back here in my next visit ."

29606,202220273,2017-10-10,25292278,Jola,"Pino was a very good host. The apartament was comfortable and nice, it had everything that we needed on such a short trip (including eg cofee, tea, sugar, olive oil-which i have never seen in airbnb before and IT was very nice to have something to drink for breakfast; and i cant say, but the bottle of wine in the fridge nearly saved our life :)). What else? We discovered that the place is very good communicated, there is a bus to thecentre (3 min walk to the Collosseum) and other directly to Vatican, also IT is close to Trastevere where you can find a lot of nice places to eat/drink sth. There is also a big supermarket near if you rather cook yourself. Pino was very friendly and answered all our questions, gave US tips about sightseeing and recommended some good, not very known places worth seeing. There were leaflets and flyers waiting in the apartament (even in Polish, which was very nice :)) and also some guides about Rome. I would definetelly recommend this place for vacation!"

29606,215353999,2017-11-29,95640914,Rizwan,Pino's place is nice and clean. Parking is on the street which is very challenging to get a spot. Heating for us was slightly insufficient but it is centrally controlled by the condo management. Floors are tiles/marble very nice but cold in winter. Pino came and told us what should we see on our 2 day trip to Rome and was readily available to answer questions by call or (Hidden by Airbnb) . I will recommend his place for a stay and I'll go back to stay there next time I'm in Rome. I suggest if you can manage with public transit as I had a very hard time with my own van that I rented.
29606,216570136,2017-12-04,155816296,Johan,"Great place to stay, really close from Bus and Metro Station. Pino is the best! Best experience in Airbnb so far."

Pino is especially welcome and made his best efforts to adapt to our complicated arrival ! He gave us a lots of interesting tips in the area and in Roma. His apartment was really well adapted to our family with all the necessary comfort. And we liked to be in Trastevere's area, as a roman experience. We enjoyed to join Roma historic center with the tramway. I hope that we will be back !"
29606,224766587,2018-01-04,16712246,Anita,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

29606,245184133,2018-03-21,23468994,Jenny,"Pino was quite accommodating, friendly and welcoming.  We felt so fortunate to find this gem since it was only 2 buildings from where a family member lives.  Loved the touches of a bookshelf in the bathroom to store our things on, spacious shower and bathtub, supply of good coffee and Moka coffee pot, goodies to eat and drink, foyer desk and tourist information.  Good access to street.  Only a few steps to the apartment from the sidewalk.  Very secure.  If youâre driving can be tricky as street parking spots are difficult to find especially at night.  Would be happy to stay there again."
29606,248264457,2018-03-31,5386316,Martin,"Pino is an excellent host and went above and beyond to accommodate us.  He provided very detailed information and Rome and the surrounding area on our arrival and made our kids very happy with some easer treats!  

The place itself is spotlessly clean with everything you might need during your stay.  It is close to public transport and there is also a huge Park very close by which is ideal for children.

Pino was also very responsive, which proved to be very important after I checked out and left my camera in the apartment...  thankfully Pino acted quickly and managed to get us to the airport just in time so we didnât miss our flight back to Hong Kong!

Thanks for a great stay!"
29606,250224307,2018-04-04,38184020,Tom,Pino was one of the most friendly and informative hosts I've ever had the pleasure to stay with! He genuinely cares that his guests enjoy their stay in Rome. Will look to stay with him again when I return.
29606,250487599,2018-04-05,120747376,Jessica,"Pinoâs apartment was fantastic. Just as described, we were very comfortable there even if it was only for one night. His place is super close to public transit, both bus and train. Pino was a great host! Communication was great and very quick to respond. We definitely plan to stay there again. Highly recommend!"

L'appartement est grand, propre, bien Ã©quipÃ©, un peu bruyant (comme Rome). Pouvoir manger en terrasse est apprÃ©ciable ! Le quartier est un peu excentrÃ©, mais proche des transports public, bus (le plus pratique) ou tramway. 

Une bonne adresse pour dÃ©couvrir Rome !"
29606,258025339,2018-04-28,59450503,Alan,Place is very clean and all amenities that you need. Pino even leaves things like Italian coffee for you in the kitchen in case you want to make some.
29606,259140218,2018-04-30,95592305,Brooke,Pino was so helpful with how we could make the best of our short trip to Rome. He had everything we needed and made us feel so comfortable. He gave us great directions and the space was a perfect place for us.
29606,260301281,2018-05-04,154097691,Joy,My family and I really enjoyed staying at Pino's apartment! It's only a 5 minute walk to buses downtown. The apartment itself was very clean and comfortably spacious.
29606,262223989,2018-05-08,81598805,Vincent,Leuke startlocatie om Rome te verkennen.

29606,266527117,2018-05-20,170660804,Shawn,This was a great introduction to Italy for our family of four adults.  Pino was a great communicator throughout our stay and especially leading up to it providing great details so that we could find it.  The apartment was perfect for us and very central to buses and some nice ristorantes.   We ate twice at Oste just near the apartment and Mariella was a wonderful hostess.  Thank you Pino for bring us such nice pastries for breakfast.  He gave us great details about the sights and how to get there.  The apartment was clean and bright and in the cluster of buildings in the courtyard it was quiet in the evening and the morning.  Go to Luna bar for the best Montepulciano wine in bulk.....take an empty container and the owner will fill it for you.  We love Pinos place and can't wait to come back.  Parking is very difficult if you have a larger vehicle which we did but we managed. Grazie mille!
29606,268168248,2018-05-24,184843425,Matthew,"The host is very welcoming, friendly, and helpful. He is a local and will help you experience as much of Rome as possible. The apartment itself is very nice, I think the pictures do not do it justice. There is a beautiful private patio and garden area outside the kitchen. Also, the kitchen is better than most Airbnbs I've seen, with all kinds of bowls and utensils. While the location is not very close to the center of Rome, the busses and taxis made everything accessible. I would recommend checking out all of the local pizzarias and the park at the end of the street. Overall, a wonderful stay."
29606,269840308,2018-05-28,52677539,Abby,"Pino was a great host, he communicated right away with us, and made sure we had everything we needed and would even go out of his way to make sure everything was perfect. He suggested  two restaurants that were both fantastic. Pino checked up on us during our stay to make sure everything was going great. We were able to walk to Romeâs main attractions for about an hours times, and a bonus was free parking. Would stay again!"

L'appartement et terrasse sympa pendant les beaux jours."
29606,276988006,2018-06-15,49242737,Dee,"Pino was a great Host! He let us check in earlier than we discussed with such short notice. 

He then personally came to greet us and gave us very valuable tips about the public transport and his recommendations for places to visit in Rome. He was very knowledgable and gave us excellent advice.

The location is excellent as its close to multiple bus stops and metros. I recommend you use public transport in Rome.

The one thing that could be improved is if there was air conditioning in the house for the hot Rome weather. 

Otherwise, I 100% recommend this property to everyone! "

And he introduced nice places and helped to refine the route to have trip.  And his place have a nice garden which have banana trees as well :) We cooked by ourselves, used washing machine."

29606,289933252,2018-07-13,182363501,Alexander,"Reliable, very good host. Very good appartment. Parking is theoretically free in the streets around, but - as usual in big cities - all crowded.
Public transportatipn by bus is available, but Rome's bus net is shâ#!%&%, esprcially on this (left) side pf River Tiber. All in all a thumbs-up recommendation."
29606,290806898,2018-07-15,121545669,Gillies,"This was a lovely, spacious apartment which was clean and well-appointed. Pino was a great host, the check-in was very quick and easy and we were provided with lots of helpful information.
The only slight (small) issue was that there isn't actually any parking on the premises (as advertised), instead there is free parking on the busy street outside the flats which sometimes is difficult to find a space.
Other than that small issue, we had a great stay at Pino's place. Grazie Pino!!"

29606,300019745,2018-08-01,23737271,Ophir,"For families, the location is challenging.
The only transportation around is located 10 minutes away but getting to the city center took about 45 minutes due to the duration and the fact that for most location, you need more than 1 line of transport. We ended up paying for taxis every night and that was something we hoped we would not need.
The supermarkets are not so close either and about 10 minutes walk. In the heat of Aug. this was a burden.
The place itself was quite, clean and easy to find. Pino was very pleasant and was available for evry question or request we had. The place has an outside garden which we used for great breakfasts. "

Pino Ã¨ molto disponibile, non lo abbiamo incontrato di persona ma siamo stati in contatto per tutto il periodo trascorso a Roma e si Ã¨ offerto di darci suggerimenti per qualsiasi problema avessimo incontrato. Ã stato anche disponibile a custodire i bagagli oltre il check out. Ancora grazie. "
29606,309581816,2018-08-18,30728001,Anna,"My family and I had a wonderful time in Pinoâs flat. The location is good - local amenities such as supermarkets, restaurants, cafes, as well as a large park - plus it is easy and quick to get the bus or tram into the city centre. The flat itself is clean and covers all the essentials we needed. I cooked meals in the kitchen and had no problems. Pino is a fabulous host. He offered a pick up service from the airport which was practical for us and our three young children. Pino has excellent knowledge of the local area plus the city centre. His business card even gave us discounts in some of the local restaurants. Iâd definitely stay at Pinoâs place again, and can recommend others to do so."
29606,310346582,2018-08-19,24347365,Endel,Pino is a wonderful host and he gave us very helpful sightseeing tips for our short one night stay in Rome. Great location.

29606,321733858,2018-09-11,1967008,Steve,"Pino was a very polite host and a great communicator. There was a bit of confusion with the parking. I had assumed ""parking on premises"" meant that a spot was guaranteed. What it meant was that the place was close to free on street parking, which isn't guaranteed and we weren't able to find a spot and had to pay to park in a garage over night. The place itself was clean and well cared for and easy to access all that Rome has to offer."
29606,322934868,2018-09-14,81266529,Jacques,TrÃ¨s bon choix en toute franchise mais sachez que le parking se fait dans la rue.
29606,323937880,2018-09-16,214411006,Makenzie,Great place to stay if you want to find a quiet place in Rome. Next to a lovely park. Pino is very friendly and can give you lots of suggestions.
29606,327682961,2018-09-24,173164087,Emilia Iuliana,"Pino is the perfect host! Always available and very approachable and pleasant, he explains very detailed all you need to know and he answers in real time to your questions. We had a very good interaction with him, even before our arrival.
We liked Pino's apartment! It is very clean, very spacious and is equipped with all the amenities for a comfortable stay in Rome. Even if is not very close to the city centre, the area is quiet, has shops and public transportation that connects it with all important Romeâs sights; you can easily get anywhere. It is very close to Trastevere train station, for those who come by train from Fiumicino. On foot, it takes more than 1 hour to reach The Center, but it is a very smooth ride. Part of the ride we did it on the famous streets of Old Trastevere. Late in the evening, we preferred to use taxi towards the accommodation. It cost us between 8 and 14 euros, depending on where we get up. Right on Pinoâs street there are several nice restaurants and cafes. We recommend! The pasta is great Rome! The apartment has a little garden with banana trees, where you can dine or enjoy a coffee or an amaro. 
We did not liked that in the bedroom were mosquitoes. But, although it was hot in September, in the apartment was ok without air-conditioning. 
Grazie Pino e alla prossima volta!"

Above all, Pino was really helpful in every ways. Thanks."

29606,355453010,2018-12-04,149829667,Prabhu,"The place is quiet, calm and the host was very informative. Place is proximate to public service, transport et all. Only when you have a vehicle there is a necessity to rent a parking close by to the house. (there is also a possibility to park your vehicle outside of the house if there is some space left.)
I would definitely rate it very high for all the assistance and amenities provided by Pino."
29606,360380466,2018-12-20,189358937,Jerry,"Pino is a great guy, works hard to make an extra Euro on this apartment, just did not expect to pay the extra money at move in time, did not really have a choice when you are in the place with your bags late at night. I believe I looked for a place with parking, and it worked out the first night, but second night I got a ticket, was not given a certain spot to park, as you would think, but oh well, it was a night big place and Pino was helpful. And, hey we were in Rome...ciao!"

29606,451718308,2019-05-12,106511028,Sven,The Appartment is really excelent and nicely located next to a beautiful park. The area is a little off the main center which make it perfect because you have a more authentic experience in the neighborhood but still very well connected to the city center. Pino was very attentive. And the banana garden is the cherry on the top.
29606,457888174,2019-05-25,7141269,Shannon,Where do I start. I loved Pinoâs place. The backyard was super handy for my two small girls. There was a local playground at the end of the street. Super easy bus routes to all the tourist attractions. Amazing deli/bakery down the street. Pino was amazing. We got a lovely bottle of Prosecco from him. The apartment was huge. By the end of the three nights we had felt like we were one of the locals. Canât recommend this place enough and so great for families. Thanks so much Pino.
29606,465787556,2019-06-08,20814966,Karolien,"The apartment is spacious and clean, a bit old but it has everything you need. It takes around 10min to walk to the tram station from where you can reach Piazza Venezia."

29606,512131285,2019-08-18,172543833,Peter,"Great location near the huge park and handy shops nearby. Good transport links via buses and trams. Clean property. Smaller than I had expected - basically a one bedroom flat, and the dining table is in the kitchen. Lovely greeting and great communications throughout. Mosquitos were a problem and we didn't use the outside space, though we were given repellents and advice."
29606,518722052,2019-08-27,34011514,David,Pino and his place are fantastic. The back terrace with its massive banana plants were a welcome oasis from the busy city.
29606,529140642,2019-09-14,228108535,Saffron,Awesome place. Close to public transport. Not full of tourists. Host was very helpful before we even arrived. Would recommend.
29606,531707743,2019-09-18,132846114,Pascal,"Pino is a very helpful and super engaged host. The communication via chat was super quick and something I never experienced before during an Airbnb stay. He also provides personal tipps during the stay which is a plus.
The apartment is near a Bus and a tram station so you will get around easily . Keep in mind that especially the bus is not really reliable.
The apartment is nice ans clean.
If you travel by car, mention it during your reservation. Maybe they can  provided a spot for you like they for us, which was super convenient.
All in all it was a exceptional experience and one of the most outstanding Airbnb stays I had."
29606,534070438,2019-09-22,289419420,Charlie,There were four of us who stayed at Pinoâs stay and there was plenty of space. We arrived and there was a bottle of Prosecco for us. Pino is a great host and it was extremely easy to communicate with him.

29606,541554986,2019-10-05,266187992,Lindsay,"Great place to stay for a young family. There is a secure garden for children to play in. It is situated away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist attractions. Being the area it is, you are more likely to be meeting locals rather than tourists"
29606,555798458,2019-10-28,60120550,Amit,The host received us at 11PM which is appreciated. Also helped us with parking on street which is also appreciated. Rome is quite busy so we parked our car and moved about in the local bus. Both the Vatican and Coloseum are 15 mins by bus. All good and much appreciated!
29606,557111177,2019-10-31,3505995,Andrew & Diane,"A great spot on the rim of beautiful Roma. Pino is an experienced host and knows how to make his guests feel very welcome. A true gentleman.

He can assist with tips and restaurants. We had a hire car but I saw bus stops nearby which would get you into the centre of Rome in approx 20mins. 

If you have a car,  parking is on the street. Whilst itâs free, itâs an urban area so spaces can be scarce.

That said the apartment is spacious, clean and well located on the ground floor. Only 5 or so steps up from the main foyer door. It is located in a residential complex. So it has a safe and community feel.

Thanks to Pino for his hospitality and advice. An enjoyable stay in amazing Rome. Grazie"

The mini kitchen was a godsend and much appreciated. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are really nice. Would recommend Emanuele's b&b to anyone wanting comfortable accommodation in Rome. Much better than a hotel. Mille grazie Emanuele e Gianni!"
31058,90363,2010-09-04,26196,Lisa,"The Airbnb team was so lucky to have been able to stay with the lovely Emanuela. From the moment we arrived she made us feel so welcome and at home with her warmth and graciousness. The accommodations look like they are straight out of Central park in New York city - super modern, pristine and colorful! The bathrooms are equipped with steam showers perfect to relax after a day of exploring, the kitchen is equipped with all the essentials including a cappuccino maker, and the breakfast Emanuela provides is one of a kind with fresh fruits and so much more. We will definitely be back!"
31058,100373,2010-09-19,211047,Robert,"We stayed here for five days in September, 2010. Would we stay again? Definitely. The room was very clean and comfortable and the shower and steam shower were great after an exhausting day of touring the city. The location is central, yet the apartment is quiet. We slept very well. Finally, Emanuela is a very kind and gracious host. "

31058,165422,2011-01-04,241080,Mary,"My husband and I spent the New Yearâs holiday in Rome and were fortunate enough to have booked the Wellness B&B. We had delightful stay. Emanuela was a wonderful hostess and the room was perfect; cozy, quiet and very private. We enjoyed the steam shower after a long day of walking around Rome, it was a proper size, not one of those mini showers you find in most European accommodations. The breakfast, snacks and little treats that were provided were sumptuous. We were able to make cappuccinoâs in the morning and enjoy them with breakfast in the privacy of our room, a true luxury! The location was great, out of the hustle of the downtown, but close enough with the major train station being a five minute walk that you werenât missing anything. Several buses pick up directly outside the door of the B&B, we had no issues with getting around to see all the major sites. There is a green market 2 minutes from the apartment, as well as a barber where my husband enjoyed a first rate haircut and shave. Every street one walks down there are surprises. We feel in love with Rome and will plan to stay in the Wellness B&B in the future. Ciao! "
31058,172901,2011-01-21,251617,Bernadette,"The apartment was easy to access from Roma Termini [short walk] and Emanuela was very welcoming. The room is compact but bright and cheerful, clean and comfortable. Free access to the kitchenette was a bonus.  We appreciated Emanuelas additional help with printing out tickets, advice on getting about and other small extras. I would happily stay here again when in Roma"
31058,226178,2011-04-14,406925,Shelly,"Beautiful apartment! This place is in a fantastic location in Rome. We absolutely loved this place. Emanuela is a doll!
It can be a bit loud at night due to the street traffic, but we learned that all of Rome is a bit noisy regardless of the time.
The apartment is the less busy area of Rome and we loved it. Two blocks away on Via Flavia is a fabulous restaurant!
Can't wait to return!"
31058,242547,2011-04-27,464289,Hussein,"Emanuela was waiting for us, she was hospitable, warm and welcoming. This is what a traveler need in a city he has not been before.

Breakfast was prepared according to our liking and was plenty.
Thank you Emanuela and we look forward to stay at your place again."
31058,246213,2011-05-01,384446,Lorraine,"Emanuela has wonderful apartments, and she lives on the premises. She was extremely helpful with directions, problems.

We will recommand this B& B to our friends and familly members. "

31058,388286,2011-07-22,333810,Mark,"My family and I had a great time in Rome! Wellness Inn Rome was a perfect fit for us and our two teenage boys! The rooms are spacious and tastefully appointed, the remote control air conditioning was a much appreciated comfort and the showers were the perfect pick me up after a hot day walking the streets of this ancient city! The location is great and the recommended restaurants and bars were very good.
Emanuela and Giovanni are gracious hosts, even going so far as to lend us the adapter off their own computer when ours got left in Paris! If you are looking for a place to stay in Rome, look no farther.We will be back!"
31058,417861,2011-08-03,790958,Nathan,"My girlfriend and I stayed in the orange room. The stay was amazing all around. For us, the place was within walking distance of everything we wanted to see -- maybe 20 minutes to the Colosseum, 15 if you're quick, and 5-10 to the train station. The breakfast was nice. Emanuela provided a map and recommendations for nearby restaurants. She also helped us reserve tickets for museums in Florence. We lost our baggage and she even lent my girlfriend a couple of shirts to wear until we recovered our bag. "

Hope she will get well soon  "

The location, while not totally central, was easily accessable to everything and very quiet, private, and safe--a nice refuge after very full days of crowds and visits.  The room was spacious, comfortable, clean, and the showers were great.  Emanuela was an absolute pleasure--helped us out with recommendations, printing, and called a taxi for the airport.  Breakfast was also nice and customized.  No complaints whatsoever.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, clean, quiet place to stay while in Rome."

31058,5251814,2013-06-20,67262,Anthony,"Bravo! Was our best experience in al the places we stayed during our three weeks in Europe. Everything and more then what we expected. Emanuela was the sweetest and most accomidating host. From the simple breakfasts she would leave us in the fridge every morning to the book of best rated places she compiled left in our room. 

Now on to the room. AMAZING! Was like our little escape from the hustle and bustle of Rome. Comfortable. Clean. Bright and RELAXING! The steam shower alone is well worth it. 

We would come back to our room after a long day in the city to find it tidy and neat. 

Location wise it was in a good area with less touristy restaurants and shopping options which was defiantly a plus for us. Walking wise we found it to be about a 20 min walk to all the big attractions like the Pantheon and a short 2-3 subway stops from the Colosseum. Really a good location with good accessibility to trains and other public transportation. 

Would definitely recommend this to anyone and we hope to stay there again during our next visit to Rome.

31058,5486369,2013-07-02,6083014,Steven,"We decided to stay at WellnessInnRome for 2 nights at the end of our Med Cruise and we made a great choice.  We walked from Termini to the b&b which took about 15 minutes with luggage and was met by Vivian who was very kind and helpful explaining how everything worked.  They had printed instructions on how to reach main attractions by public transit.  A simple breakfast was provided each morning.  The area is very quiet and safe.  The British Embassy is right across the street and several other Embassies were in the neighbourhood so there was always army guards on the street corners nearby.  The highlight of the room has to be the steam shower with rain faucet from the ceiling!  And the cappuccino machine provided for use anytime you wanted.  We did not get to meet Emanuela but Vivian was great and easy to reach by text.  We were able to check in early and check out late!!!  

Thanks Emanuela and Vivian for a great place to stay while visiting Rome!

Emanuela was an excellent host.  She went out of her way on several occasions to make arrangements for us--picking us up at the airport (arriving at night) and at the end of our stay helping us secure transportation to Civitavecchia to board our Cruise Ship.  Thank you Emanuela!  Our room was always clean and tidy when we returned from a full day of exploring Rome.  We highly recommend Wellness Inn!"

The shower is just awesome and the breakfest has a very good quality. Very recommendable. The only thing is that one is a little bit dependent on the neighbour in the other room, but that is always the case if you don't decide for a whole flat on your own ;)"

Le BnB est tel que dÃ©crit dans la fiche, trÃ¨s propre (le mÃ©nage est fait chaque jour), lumineux et trÃ¨s confortable. La douche est trÃ¨s bien, grande, et la kitchenette Ã  l'entrÃ©e trÃ¨s pratique. Emanuela a adaptÃ© notre petit dÃ©jeuner au fil des jours selon nos envies et ses possibilitÃ©s, ce qui Ã©tait trÃ¨s gentil. Elle est trÃ¨s discrÃ¨te mais prÃ©sente si besoin.
La chambre est situÃ©e dans le quartier des ambassades, c'est calme, bien frÃ©quentÃ©, et pas trÃ¨s loin de Termini Ã  pied. De plus, les mÃ©tro A et B sont accessibles Ã  pied et de nombreux bus passent juste en bas de l'immeuble. C'est au 4e Ã©tage avec ascenseur, trÃ¨s commode.
Encore merci Ã  Emanuela pour ce sÃ©jour qui correspond exactement Ã  ce que nous souhaitions en partant."

Her home had everything I needed for a relaxing and welcoming stay in Rome - breakfast was just what I needed before heading out for the day, and the room and bathroom were modern, clean and a nice oasis from the busy city. I would not hesitate to stay again at Wellness Inn Rome. Thank you so much Emanuela."

Emanuela met us at the door and showed us around.  There is a folder describing places to see and eat and importantly where not to eat.
The room is airy and bright, with a fabulous steam/shower cubicle.
The location is quiet with an excellent Gelateria a short walk away.

This is the best Airbnb we have stayed in, and I totally recommend it.
Thanks Emanuela. "

31058,34203520,2015-06-06,20262442,Yj,"I stayed at Emanuela's beautiful place for two days. My mother and I loved the Orange Room! Everything was perfect. In fact, the best part of our stay in Rome was Wellness Inn! Air conditioning and Wifi worked perfectly well and breakfast was great too; Emanuela prepared the lovely breakfast tray during the night for us to take anytime the next morning so we were able to have a hearty start for the day before leaving for Vatican very early. 
Thank you Emanuela for the wonderful experience! "

The pantry next to the room was well equipped!"
31058,46392038,2015-09-10,9577918,Sandra,"Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt bei Emanuela sehr genossen.
Das Zimmer war sehr schÃ¶n eingerichtet und sauber, ebenso das Badezimmer.
Die Klimaanlage hat prima funktioniert, auch war das Zimmer wunderbar leise und dunkel, eine rundum erholsame Unterkunft.

Das FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck war ansprechend angerichtet und abwechslungsreich, auch gab es tagsÃ¼ber kostenlosen Kaffee und Tee.
Emanuela war sehr nett und hat uns im Vorfeld Tipps fÃ¼r die beste Anreise zu ihrem B&B zukommen lassen.

Das B&B liegt im vierten Stock eines Hauses und ist generell sehr modern eingerichtet.
Der Hausflur ist leider etwas heruntergekommen, hier sind momentan aber auch in den Ã¼brigen Wohnungen Renovierungen im Gange, so dass das Haus vielleicht bald auch vom Eingangsbereich her mit Emanuelas tollen Zimmern mithalten kann.
Man ist in relativer StadtnÃ¤he, d.h. man kann zu FuÃ zur Spanischen Treppe und ins Zentrum laufen, es sind ungefÃ¤hr 20 â 30 Minuten in denen man ein paar spannende Botschaften, HÃ¤user und Museen sehen kann.
In der nÃ¤heren Umgebung gibt es einige schÃ¶ne Restaurants und SupermÃ¤rkte, alles fuÃlÃ¤ufig gut erreichbar innerhalb von 5 Minuten.

Wir kÃ¶nnen die Unterkunft alles in allem also nur empfehlen.

Ein kleines Manko war bei unserem Aufenthalt von 4 NÃ¤chten, dass wir ein Duschtuch und ein kleines auf den Boden gelegt hatten zum Wechseln, das wurde aber leider nicht gemacht.
Das wÃ¼rde ich mir fÃ¼r die Zukunft noch wÃ¼nschen, dass man bei mehr als zwei NÃ¤chten ein neues Paar erhÃ¤lt.

Ansonsten war aber alles prima und wir kommen gerne noch einmal zurÃ¼ck.

31058,74922619,2016-05-17,59564204,Ivo,"Tutto era perfetto!
We stayed 3 days in WellnessInn Rome. Emanuela met us with smile at the door. The room was perfectly decorated, spacious, bright and clean. Every morning we had a nicely arranged breakfast. We really enjoyed the shower in the bathroom.
The location is in quiet area, close to the metro station, Termini Station and on a walking distance to the most of the attractions of the city. There are lots of neat restaurants nearby and one of the best Gelaterias in Rome.
We totally enjoyed our staying and definitely will recommend it to our friends. If visiting Rome again we will choose the same place to stay.
Grazie, Emanuela.

A binder with information was provided. The bed was so comfortable.   Breakfast was ready every morning and our room was cleaned daily.  The room was in a great location.  We loved it - thank you for an amazing stay in Rome.  Brenda and Joe

Emanuela showed us how to get where we wanted to go, and she was always available to answer questions. The room was very clean and comfortable, with good wifi, soap in the shower and plenty of pillows and towels. There was a nice wardrobe in the room that we used as well.

There is a clean cute kitchen. Everything you need can find there. Even some cookies and tea)))

The room was well organized, everything put in place. The neighborhood is located quiet east of Rome in a neighborhood where many foreigners leave. Transportation is not bad. Usually 35 minutes from Termini. Bus station is closely located. As long as you don't stay till late night, which you shouldnt do in other districts also, you will be okay. She respects privacy so recommend for anyone who need a private room."

I always felt free to come and go whenever I wished to but Tiziana was also free for a cup of coffee in the kitchen or a tisana in the evening and a nice chat. She told me about several interesting spots that I visited during my stay and I felt very comfortable in the neighbourhood. It is full of life and there are much nice little Pizzerie and Gelaterie and Bars. The room was as described, everything was cosy and clean. When I come back to Rome I am happy to meet Tiziana again and I can highly recommend her as a host!"
31102,32269301,2015-05-16,29587081,Helen,"Really lovely little apartment in a quiet neighbourhood. It's about 35 minutes to Termini station by public transit, but there is a bus stop less than 5 minutes from the front door, and several markets to choose from if you want to cook for yourself. As a single female traveler I never felt unsafe while staying here. 

Tiziana is a great host and a lovely person. We shared many interesting conversations over dinner and tea. Se has breakfast set out for you each morning and is more than willing to offer guidance in any way she can in navigating the city. It was also really nice to be out of the busy city centre in order to relax and unwind in the evenings."

Highly recommended!
31102,33755892,2015-05-31,28709362,Jackson,"Tiziana was a great host, very talkative and friendly. Her place is about an hour walk from Termini, but only 15-20 min by tram or bus. The area around her apartment isn't the nicest neighborhood in town, but is by no means dangerous. I walked through there at 1 in the morning and felt very safe. The room she put me in was clean, comfortable, and cozy. She also provides breakfast which is an added bonus. Definitely recommended, especially for the overall value. "

She helped me out to figure out travel plans and stuff. We respect our own time as well. It was heart warming she prepared me a breakfast on the table with her hand writing note thats so so cute :)
31102,36804120,2015-07-01,17170770,Deanna,"Tiziana is a kind, generous, and gracious host. She welcomed me with open arms. Her home is charming and has lovely accents of commissioned wall art. For those travelers who enjoy being out of the congested tourist-heavy areas in Rome and relish a diverse neighborhood with kind folk, affordable markets and delicious restaurants, and easy commute in-and-out of the city, this is the place. As a solo female traveler, I felt secure and welcome in the vibrant neighborhood. There are multiple bus access points to reach Arco di Travertino and Tiburtina metro stations (about 10 minutes to 20m to each, one station is quite walkable). I will say, if you are the kind of traveler who considers the more sterile, tourist-fronting presentations of a journey, this neighborhood may encourage you to expand your comfort zone. That is to say, I loved this home, it's host, and the neighborhood."
31102,37479762,2015-07-07,10363024,Dina,Tiziana is the most wonderful host ever! She answered all my questions and gave me useful advices. The breakfasts and especially coffee were really good and tasty. If you want sincere and home like atmosphere you should stay here.
31102,40729682,2015-08-02,32212042,Sebastiaan,"I have had a good time staying at Tiziana's appartment while following a three week summer course in Ancient Greek.

The appartment was clean and the room tidy. Tiziana had put breakfast ready in the kitchen every morning. I especially appreciated the coffee. âº

The bus stop was around the corner. It takes about ten minutes to reach the Arco di Travertino metro station.

The neighborhood is away from the centre. I could sometimes hear noises from the street at night. Around midnight it would be quiet.

Tiziana was very friendly and hospitabIe. One night while she was away a friend delivered everything needed for breakfast. I had the feeling I enjoyed a lot of freedom in her appartment.

I would recommend Tiziana's appartment to anyone who wants to stay in Rome, especially for a longer period."
31102,44716774,2015-08-28,41918611,Rock,Tiziana's apartment was exactly what I was looking for. An affordable little place away from the tourist trap yet close to a bus stop and not far from a metro station. I experienced a slice of Roman life not advertised on the brochures. There are plenty of cafes and convenient stores where you can shop without being charged tourist prices. Tiziana was easy to communicate and always very helpful. I hope to be back in Rome soon as there was so much to see and do in so little time!
31102,46294107,2015-09-09,40275513,Christoffer Niebuhr,"Tiziana was truly a great host. She was extremely kind and showed true Italian hopsitality. Most importantly she was extremely helpful in every type of cituation. She helped with translating Italian, explaining how to get around town and where to go. My stay at Tizianas place was by far better than any stay I have had at any hostel or low budget hotel.

The multicultural neighbourhood which she lives in is great.I always felt safe and It has everything you need with easy access to the metro A line."

Tizziana Ã© uma otima anfitria, que alÃ©m de fornecer um local confortÃ¡vel e seguro Ã© extremamente receptiva e amorosa. Deixa pequenos bilhetes com orientaÃ§Ãµes e pequenos mimos tornando a hospedagem algo mais caloroso e verdeiro. Apesar de interagirmos pouco, pois eu estava a trabalho e bastante atarefada, me senti hospedada com uma amiga!!

Ella es muy agradable y acogedora, me senti muy comoda ;) En el poco tiempo que compartimos, ya que estabamos en distintos horarios en casa, conversamos un poco y ella es muy divertida! Logra sacar muchas sonrisas y transmite mucha alegria :) :) :) La habitacion y la casa estan super bien! ;) Y el barrio sobre todo, muy bien conectado con el centro (bus, metro, tranvia), pero tambien muy interesante para caminar y recorrer por alli, pues muestra otro lado curioso de la ciudad, ademas de los lugares 'tradicionales' y 'turisticos'. Le recomendaria este hospedaje a cualquier persona que me preguntara donde dormir en Roma ;)"

From the moment I arrived and until I left Tiziana made sure I had all the information on what to see and how to get around Rome, including how to get home late at night. 

Tiziana's place is easy to find and in a very nice neighbourhood with nice places to eat and convenient market nearby. Her home is comfortable, cosy and clean and I am very grateful every morning that she had a small breakfast, teas and coffee prepared for her guests, which is a nice touch. 

If you enjoy good conversations then you will enjoy speaking with Tiziana. She is a well travelled, well educated and cultured woman,  who knows how to speak a good selection of languages. I enjoyed talking with her about languages, culture, travel and world affairs.

Whenever I come back to Rome I will definitely stay again, if I can. Great place with a very friendly and welcoming host makes a visit truly magical. Thank you Tiziana! "

31102,131687149,2017-02-13,55273821,Zen,Tiziana is friendly and helpful. I do enjoy staying at her place.
31102,133246214,2017-02-21,32943902,Alexander,"Great stay, great host, great location. Highly recommended!"
31102,133888365,2017-02-25,111549773,Monica,"IncreÃ­ble! Mi mejor experiencia en airbnb!!! Tiziana es una persona super amable, te ayuda en lo que tu necesites y te da consejos de como moverte por la.ciudad y que lugares visitar. 
Te sientes de verdad en casa. Con tu privacidad pero ella siempre estÃ¡ para ayudarte y puedes platicar muy agusto con ella."
31102,134976725,2017-03-02,114400359,Giuliana,"Go ahead, book with Tiziana, don't doubt it. I stayed with her for two nights in order to visit Rome for the first time. Her neighborhood is a chill place, very secure. I came late at night and everything was calm and safe. She can easily explain you the public transport.

At the end of the day when you go to a town for the first time what you appreciate the most is to be safe and comfy. She is a warm and caring person and welcomes you to her home. If I'd come back I would definitely stay here again. :)"

31102,137932414,2017-03-18,117503038,Sandra,"Tiziana is a nice host and will gladly give you local information. The place is very local and quite accesible; I always went home from Termini and found bus 105 to be an easier choice (because I knew that when I see Carrefour Market on the right, I need to press the ""Bus stop requested"" button and get off the bus at the next stop; for this bus you have to wait about 10 minutes). Overall, I had a nice stay and an awesome time in Rome (I recommend using Roma Pass 24/48/72h)."
31102,138509284,2017-03-20,23045545,Shelly,"Tiziana is such a welcoming and warm soul. I felt like I was at home at her place. I enjoyed that the apartment was in a working class neighborhood since it parallels the neighborhood I live in at home in NYC - very diverse and lively while also being safe. The room was bright (lots of natural light), comfortable and clean. Breakfast was yummy too and an added bonus/treat. I would recommend a stay here to anyone. I would most definitely stay here again when I return to Rome!"
31102,139372061,2017-03-25,103071485,Nallely,Tiziana is amazing! She seriously helped me through a midlife crisis and honestly if she didn't offer the resources she did and talk to me I wouldn't have known what to do. Her Airbnb is cozy and the wall art was beautiful! She was very informative and even drew pictures for me! This made it easy to get around. There was also tons of good restaurants nearby which was convenient for dinner time. This was the best Airbnb experience I've had yet!

The location is away from the centre so its not too busy but still close enough to get there quickly via public transport. Citymapper is a real help and remember they drive on the right side of the road in Italy! (hopefully this will stop others getting the bus from the wrong side of the road like I did a couple of times..)

Tiziana is an amazing person, extremely helpful, easy-going and polite and the flat is really clean and quiet. Furthemore, I haven't had any difficoulty to get to places were I had to arrive to. If I should come back to Rome, I already know where I'm going to sleep!"
31102,220417615,2017-12-22,159628144,Odile,"I had a great stay! At first I was a bit concerned because the apartment seemed far from the center of Roma, but finally it wasn't a problem at all. There's a line of buses (always crowded however) 100mt far from the apartment, or else the tram just a bit further. Tiziana is a wonderful woman who cares about your needs and your wellness. I felt really welcomed in her apartment, even though I was a total stranger. She speaks very well English, Italian and French, and maybe even more languages. The room was clean and very pretty. The apartment is quite small but there's everything you need. I can only recommend her. I'll be happy to stay again at her place if I ever get back to Rome!"

I feel like a real Roman after staying with her she taught me how to travel around Rome and to other cities helping me find the Tiburtina. The house was perfectly located near all of the major sites took me no time to get to any of the sites. Tiziana prepared breakfast complete with Italian coffee and tea every morning, even the time of me leaving. I am forever grateful to her."
31102,237497345,2018-02-23,55549785,Moeko,"Great place if youâre look for a cheap place to stay. Not in the center but still very close to public transport and 30-40 min to Termini station. Breakfast is very small so better to bring your own ones. Very clean but the shower cabin is tiny as long as youâre not under 160cm. 
A bit of noise from other floors or neighbors.
Her hospitality was amazing, you can ask if you have any doubts or questions or requests. I unfortunately caught cold but she gave me medicine and thermometer. Also she kindly went for grocery store and get some food instead of me. I really appreciate it. Also central heating worked pretty good. I could stay warm. 
Thank you Tiziana for everything!"

Vanaf het moment dat de deur open ging voelde ik me thuis. En tijdens mijn reis richting Rome nam ze contact met me op om me te informeren over het OV...vanwege de sneeuw reed niet alles. Ze heeft me toen goed geholpen. Zo lief!"

31102,243014912,2018-03-14,168746408,Suzy,"Tizianaâs place is awesome. Itâs clean and quiet (as much as Italy can be) and Tiziana is a very thoughtful host. Sheâs very nice :) and her coffees are the best. Also, her llace is located just 30 mins away from most sights in central Rome so itâs very budget friendly as well as practical. Iâll be sure to be back at tizianaâs place when I visit Roma next time"
31102,244640599,2018-03-19,16110119,Russell,"Tizianaâs place is cozy, well-appointed, and quiet. I messed up my date of arrival and she was very understanding, accommodating me with no problem at all, and she was a very helpful and thoughtful host. The apartment is a bit out of the center of Rome, so be prepared to use/understand the public transit in the areaâwhich is quite simple to use. Great value and highly recommended!"

31102,258078212,2018-04-28,174066039,Mark,"This apartment is great value accommodation. I found it cosy, and it is located 2 minutes from a bus to the centre and 3 minutes from a nice restaurant. The street that the apartment is located on is not the nicest to look at but I never felt uncomfortable walking around there. The host, Tiziana, was incredibly welcoming right from the very start. She offered great tips for the sights to see in Rome and how to get to them. She also gives a small breakfast, a croissant with a coffee and/or tea, and once even asked if I wanted an ice cream she just bought! Tiziana is a really nice host and I had a great stay there."

Fast wi-fi, clean towels and bedding, heating, pots and pans to cook. For breakfast there are cookies and coffee.
In the area there are many fruit and vegetable mini-shops, Coop and Carrefour supermarkets. Carrefour works around the clock. There is convenient transport accessibility. The nearest metro can be quickly reached by bus 409. There is also a bus 105 and trams to Termini station.

The best part where always the encounters in the kitchen which let to very interesting conversations over a cup of coffee or tea.
I can only recommend her place to stay since it is also very easy to get anywhere in Rome with the local public transportation system.
Looking forward coming back."

She took time to explain the public transport system to me and showed me the best spots to visit. It was no problem to cook little meals in the evening. The room was small but cozy and everything was clean. You have to consider that the apartment is not in the city centre but if it doesn't bother you to use the public transport, it's the perfect place for a city trip to Rome! Thank you so much, Tiziana! :)"

Not only is her apartment super clean and comfortable, she also likes to make sure she gives you all the advice you need. She recommended places I should visit, gave me tips on public transportation, and even had snacks for me one day! Getting to the city center from the apartment is super easy, and I felt safe the whole time. The amenities are all thatâs needed for a comfortable stay, the bed is comfortable and thereâs enough space in the room, and the bathroom is super clean.

31430,75151,2010-08-07,63613,Patricia,"Angiola was very kind and helpful,  giving me info on what to see in Rome and how to get around on the public transport.  Her english is very good  which was great because my italian is terrible!!

The area she lives is a little further out of the centre, which I liked as it was a  quieter and less touristy, still with many shops and cafes. She is close to VIlla Ada  which is beautiful and I really enjoyed walking around her neighbourhood.

It still has very good and easy connections into the centre and tourist attractions.  Was also very easy to get to her from the airport as you can get the train direct to her stop 'Nomentana'.

The apartment was full of character , very clean and comfortable.

I would definitely recommend it to other travelers."
31430,80341,2010-08-17,94868,Leo,"Angiola was the kindest host to us, even though her apartment is located quite far from the sites we wanted to visit. However, she made sure we felt comfortable enough during our staying at her house. Charles & TiingTing"
31430,87003,2010-08-30,165511,Gloria,"I you need a place to stay in Rome. I will recommend you to stay with Angiola. I stayed at her home with my sister.  She was very open, friendly, and helps us in everything we need. She walked the second mille with us and for that we are very grateful.

THANKS ANGIOLA!"
31430,114224,2010-10-08,236233,Ben,"Angiola was a very kind host.  Several times throughout our stay she was able to point us in the direction of wonderful museums or things to do in Rome.  The last night we were in town she selected and made reservations for us at a wonderful restaurant, and helped us with our 3am taxi (Thanks again Agiola).

As far as the room goes everything was wonderful.  The room was large and had a nice balcony to sit and read on.  The entire apartment was very clean and comfortable.  The only thing that Angiola could do to improve the room would be to provide a thicker mattress on the pull out bed - it was a bit lumpy; I was still able to sleep well on it, though. This is something that Angiola commented on and said she was looking to address.

I would stay here in the future, and recommend it to others.

31430,207259,2011-03-23,361183,Kate,"I was so grateful to have discovered airbnb.com because it led me to Angiola and her very warm and welcoming home.  While the location is not central, it is conveniently connected to the center of Rome by easy bus routes.  The neighborhood is charming, very residential with great little shops and bakeries.  Angiola made me feel like one of the gang, and she took great care to ensure my comfort and ease in Rome. One night, in search of a good restaurant nearby, Angiola called several places for me, inquiring after cuisine and pricing, eventually walking me to a local restaurant that would have been difficult for me to find on my own. Above and beyond to not begin to describe!  Also, Angiola's roommates were particularly lovely, creating a very friendly and caring atmosphere. Important note:  the previously mentioned mattress situation  (in an earlier review) has been resolved!  The too-thin/lumpy mattress has been replaced by one that was very comfortable, offering me some of the best sleep I had in my month-long trip in Italy.  Grazie mille Angiola!  If and when I get the chance to return the Rome, Angiola's is the place I'll be staying."

31430,302891,2011-06-07,620737,Souvik,"Angiola was a great host. The first day, she showed us around her neighborhood, and gave us dinner recommendations. We ended up going to the deli that she recommended every day for delicious antipasti. She was very knowledgeable about Rome, and even got up at 4am to help us arrange a taxi ride to the train station. If you're in Rome, you should definitely try to stay with Angiola."
31430,308135,2011-06-11,588635,Cara,"I stayed with Angiola for four nights before my sister arrived in Rome to join me.  It was a lovely, clean place and easy to find.

All in all, I had a great time staying in Angiola's home!"

Amenities were adequate, and room private and comfortable.  Though location was farther out than ideal,  I had a wonderful visit to catacombs just a few blocks away from her house that was a bonus to the location. Recommend the tour which is a pleasant contrast to the bigger attractions and crowds. I thouroughly enjoyed the converstaions i had with Angiola on her  interesting life experiences , which added to the experience of the visit. Ask her about the pastry shop near the bus stop which is to die for. It begins with an M and has a yellow awning.  "

Although the weather is so hot the room is nice because the air current came from windows. it is almost 20 min to city center by bus.

I really enjyed there and I highly recommended her to you if are looking for a nice and cheap place to stay in rome. Thanks Angiola"

Instead of cancelling my stay Angiola made sure that I had alternative accomodation (with her Sister  Maria). Thank you so much - YOU ARE TRUELY AMAZING !!!!***Maria and Lorenzo where the bests hosts and so kind......nothing was to much - thank you!
When I did meet Angiola made sure that I was taken care of and even bought me a train tkt to get to the airport - as it was the trains where not running (to the airport) so I had to take a taxi...Angiola offered to help with the fare.....
Angiola I would like to THANK you so much for looking after me - your awesome!! & plse let  Maria & Lorenzo knw that I said a BIG THANKS for accomodation me & again for being so kind/gracious hosts.

THANKS AGAIN !!!!;-)))"
31430,475731,2011-08-26,362202,Dafne,My stay with Angiola in Rome was an excellent choice. I can recommend Angiolaâs place to all travellers with an interest in art and history. I enjoyed the conversations with her during the morning coffee. She when gave me a lot of suggestions for spots to see in Rome that were not in my travel-guide. An extra plus is that Angiola speaks english fluently. Angiola is very hospitable: she introduced me to the family of her sister. To be so âcloseâ with a roman family was a true privilege to me.
31430,643989,2011-10-18,870023,Leticia,"Angiola es una gran anfitriona, nos ayudo mucho en cuanto a manejarnos con los buses ( dado que queda un poco lejos de las atracciones) y a donde salir a pasear.
Es super atenta y siempre dispuesta.
Hasta nos hizo pasta el primer dia que llegamos!!
El apartamento es confortable y muy limpio. La habitacion espaciosa y luminosa,
No me queda nada mas que recomendar este lugar!!"
31430,690564,2011-11-03,1216934,Marni,"We stayed 3 nights in Rome and were very happy with our stay with Angiola. It is a little out of the way - but she provided us with excellent directions to get to the area by bus (about 25 minutes) and then she and her sister picked us up at the bus stop. It was actually nice to be away from the crowds in downtown Rome and we visited the Priscella catacombs which were 10 minutes' walk away - very interesting and something we likely would not have done had we stayed downtown. The room was clean and comfortable and Angiola was a marvelous host - told us about sites, showed us how to get places, loaned us a fabulous transit map, and even walked us to the bus the first day so we would not get lost. And breakfast was great too - we would highly recommend staying with Angiola for anyone who wants to stay outside the central Rome area."
31430,1180390,2012-04-25,2045871,Hila,"Angiola is an Angel! She is the loveliest and welcoming host. She came to pick us up from the train station on the first day we arrived to Rome and actually made dinner with wine for us!!! 
We immediately felt at home and in good hands. Her generosity and open heart made our trip easier. She is always ready to help and be there for her guests. We loved her breakfasts, the coffee, fresh squeezed juice, breads and other little goodies that were beyond what she had to do. It was great to learn from her about the city and the culture and also to meet other guests that stayed there. She is an interesting person with wide knowledge of art history and cultures.
Angiolaâs place is beautiful, clean and spacious. The bed is very comfortable and the room is big. It was great to have our own private bathroom. Angiola really makes you feel at home and relaxed.
I highly recommend staying with Angiola.  I hope she can visit us in Vancouver soon. Thanks to her our trip went smoothly and will be memorable forever!
"
31430,1208962,2012-05-01,1867639,Susan,"My husband and I loved our stay with Angiola, and her inviting flat in Rome. Our room was very comfortable with all the essentials,  and gratefully quiet., and the  private bath room was more than wonderful.  

Angiola was the perfect host - she welcomed us personally, and took us on a tour of the neighborhood, showing us first hand - transportation, shopping and eating places.  One we liked  particularly, and frequented daily for a morning coffee, and evening wine, and even fine quiet dinners. It was just around her corner and had a French name !  Angiola was always accessible and responsive to any requests (like laundry)  or questions we had.  We enjoyed her as a warm and giving person, and if ever we visit  Rome again, would return to reconnect with her. 

As other reviews have mentioned ,  her flat is a 15 to 20 minute bus ride to the historic center.  But,  we actually liked the idea of coming back after a full day of crowds, touring, and walking to a peaceful and uncrowded area of the city.  The only thing that does take time, is waiting for the buses.  But, soon there is to be a metro station opening, and that will add to the convenience of getting to ""centro.""

The accommodations she provided were a great value.
"
31430,1262895,2012-05-11,2040561,Nina,"The two weeks that we stayed with Angiola in Rome were two of the most memorable and enjoyable weeks of our visit to Italy. Being long-term travellers (overland from England to Australia!) we were so grateful to break our journey in a place where we felt so welcome, relaxed and appreciated. Angiola is the embodiment of kindness and generosity. She shares her space effortlessly and takes a great interest in the people who cross her path. The apartment is equipped with every convenience you could possibly desire and is always clean and tidy. The local neighbourhood is delightful, with cafes, delis, fruit and veg markets, green spaces and gelateria. A wonderful way to explore Rome without the tourist hype, and to feel like a local, if only for a little while. The bus and train connections to the city are frequent and easy to navigate. Angiola was extremely helpful in letting us borrow a map and guidebook. She also made wonderful suggestions about unusual and interesting places to visit.  After our visit to Rome Angiola was kind enough to invite us to stay in her country home in Molise - a green, unspoiled of region of Italy where we have spent two relaxed and inspiring weeks. We would love to return to Rome again one day and spend many months living in this light-filled and comfortable apartment. Thank you Angiola - we feel very blessed to have met you."

We could use a kitchen and had our private bathroom what is the most important for me to feel comfortably. We had also breakfasts and internet connection. The apartment is situated near public transport which is very efficient in Rome. A district is very peaceful and pleasant with blossoming flowers and green.  You can live among locals away from tourists. Rome is a place where everybody can feel at home. Angiola, molto grazie for your hospitality :)"
31430,1373429,2012-05-29,2214668,Ceda,"This was a great room in the Nomentana neighborhoood of Roma. It's a little bit further away from the city center, but you get the sense of how real Romans live. The apartment is spacious and each resident has their own bathroom. The privacy is great. As soon as the Libia station opens, it will be a very easy commute from the center of Roma. Angiola was not able to see us very much, but her sister made sure we found the apartment and necessities. The other roommates provided the rest of the information. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Nomentana. "
31430,1395994,2012-06-01,2299245,Aiga,"We stayed with Angiola during our honeymoon in Italy and our first experience with Airbnb was very positive! The location was very good, city centre only 20 minutes away by bus. The room was clean, the bed very comfy, private bathroom was a nice bonus. Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to spend more time with Angiola, but from the time that we did share together we can see that she is a very good host! She was friendly, helpful and trustworthy. We would recomend her to anybody! "
31430,1426767,2012-06-06,2247351,Benjamin & Claire,"Thanks a lot to Angiola for her warm welcome! We can really recommend to spend some days at Angiola's place. It's quite, clean and well located. It's very convenient when you are coming from the airport to go to Angiola's place and it takes 15 min by bus to go to the city center! 

Angiola has also very good advices to provide about Rome, its culture and the places (not the one with many tourists) to see!

Claire & Benjamin"
31430,1444310,2012-06-09,1766272,Ruslan&Yulia,"We arrived to Rome from the Toscana by the car and easy foung Angiola appartament, she allowed us to stay the car in her garrage that was a very easy. Appartament was nice and we could see Italian lifestyle. Angiola met us very warm and friendly, room with the private bathroom is tidy and cozy. Moreover, we got a shelf in the fridge with a food for breakfast! Angiola went with us to bus stop and explained how can we get to centre and come back to home. Time in Rome was realy nice! Thank you Angiola! Hope to visit you again!"
31430,1551102,2012-06-24,2564281,Nicholas,"Angiola was a very kind and incredibly welcoming host. She has a very warm nature. She was very patient in helping us plot out our couple days spent in Rome in great detail. Her apartment was homely, clean and very charming. A lovely woman and a lovely apartment."
31430,1583428,2012-06-28,1377527,Shinar,"The experience was just great and really made my stay in Rome so special. Angiola is caring, intelligent, warm-hearted person with multiple interests and exciting projects.  Angiola has made me feel like at home, cooked me delicious Italian breakfasts, helped with my travels. 

The apartment is spacious, clean, very cosy and quite. The room is very nice and has a private bathroom. The location is wonderful, as it is relatively afar from the noisy center, but at the same time convenient and easy to get to the main sights, especially with the new metro line. It takes less that 10 mins to the city center.

I would definitely recommend staying at Angiola's place and would like to come back again! "
31430,1690757,2012-07-12,2594060,Thanos,The accommodation was very hospitable and pleasurable. The owner was always kind and willing to give you all the basic info in order to make your tour in the town easier! The location was really helpful as you needed only 10-15' to get to the center of the town. Generally i can say that the ratio between the price and the services provided was really satisfying!
31430,1721665,2012-07-16,2218739,Rachel,"Angiola was such a delightful and helpful person who made our stay in Rome so enjoyable we wanted to stay longer! She was so considerate when we told her we had missed our flight and that we would be arriving late into the night, and told us of all the different routes to get to her home - which made our very long and tiresome day much nicer!
The room was fantastic as well. Big, clean and comfortable for me and my friend Jasmine. We had a private bathroom and both the bedroom and bathroom we located at the other side of the house so we had privacy. Breakfast was amazing every day!! Angiola set up a little spot in her kitchen (which was always clean) for us to dine next to the window. All in all, our stay with Angiola was such a delightful experience! We wish we never left!"

31430,1832961,2012-07-29,3018364,Anita,"My parents had a magical time with Angiola! It was lovely and pleasant and truly beautiful home. Her guidance was also superb, knowledgeable and inspiring. If they return to Rome, they would want to stay only at her place again. They loved her."
31430,1894724,2012-08-05,3009885,Sophie,"We had a very pleasant stay in Rome at Angiola's house. She was very kind and helpful and gave us good tips for sightseeing, eating and relaxing. The room was big and the private bathroom was a big plus. The breakfast was also good! Fresh Illy coffee every morning:) The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and the beach was easy to reach from the house with the metro. We really recommend a stay at Angiola's house!"
31430,2054338,2012-08-21,2843426,Anne Marie,"Angiola was a very kind host, starting with meeting us at the train station and helping us out where needed. We felt very much at ease in her apartment with comfortable accommodations and a nice niche for breakfast. It was great to be close to the metro and easy to reach the center of Rome. Thank you, Angiola!"
31430,3159751,2012-12-26,4280082,Michael,"Angiola was an incredible hostess who I am completely indebted to. Not only was the room I stayed in at her apartment a perfect spot with easy access to the rest of the city via the metro, but she was wonderfully gracious and generous to me during my time there, allowing me to join her for dinner during the holiday - an experience that truly made my visit to Rome singular and special. I can't recommend her enough!"
31430,3183268,2012-12-29,1226343,Timur,"If you don't mind staying a 10-minute subway ride out (on B1), this is a wonderful place. Big room, comfortable bed, your own bathroom, a lovely breakfast, and a great host. Make sure to stop at the cafe around the block -- Angiola will tell you how to get there."
31430,3239477,2013-01-03,1525457,Marielle,"Angiola has been very kind and helpful in recommending sights and places. Her flat is very clean easy to find, well located only 5 mins away from metro LIBIA and the room is large and pleasant. The private bathroom is also roomy and added to our comfort. Finally, breakfast was plentiful (bread, coffee, milk, fruit, panettone, juice) and the table was laid for us every morning. We have enjoyed ourselves very much!"
31430,3626508,2013-02-26,4926144,Jean-Marie & Solange,"Our stay in Roma was great and Angiola's house very pleasant.
Moving to the town center or any area is quite easy as buses and metro are not very far.
We could easily talk to Angiola or other lodgers we met in the kitchen at mealtimes, we appreciated it greatly.
The bedroom and bathroom were quite enjoyable too. So we recommend sincerely Angiola's home."
31430,3773762,2013-03-13,4706850,Riku,"Angiola is a wonderful woman. She provided us with all of the things I needed. Location was good. Close to supermarket and subway station, they were convenient for me. I also want to stay."

The calm location is very well linked with all spots via metro and bus. Lots of small shops and a marked hall can be found nearby in the quarter.
Recommendable!
"
31430,3936861,2013-03-29,4774852,Sule,We stretched the space intended for two to three; we had our 8yo with us. Angiola was a good host; we didn't see much of her as she was sick. It was a pity because she was going to show us around her favourite city of Rome. Our air schedule meant that we had to leave a day earlier than expected. None of that detracted from Angiola being a good host. We would recommend her place to anyone who wanted the experience of home stay while in Rome. The others who were there gave the place an international flair. The apartment was ideally located to eateries and the Metro and moving around was easy.    
31430,4030127,2013-04-04,2138620,Mary Ann,"I had a wonderful stay with Angiola. The place was clean, situated in a great location, close to trains and buses, cafes, and grocery. The bedroom and bathroom were good sizes and there was enough room to move around, I didn't feel cramped. The elevator was a plus because after a long day of walking I just couldn't do the stairs anymore. I wish I had spent more time with Angiola, it was helpful that she was speaking Italian with me so I could practice and be ready to speak it in public. Her sister Pia was so nice to come get me from the station when I got lost and was tired. They're both nice ladies. I will definitely book with Angiola again soon."
31430,4115976,2013-04-11,2431236,Levent,"Angiola has been a great host to us with useful tips and advice. It is a shame that we have not been able to spend more time with her.
The room was lovely.Location is a bit off-centre with very good train connection to the airport and underground is quite practical with a lot of places in the city if not all."
31430,4180028,2013-04-16,4638967,Alexandra,"Our stay in Angiola's room was a pleasure ! She was very nice and we are greatful for her hospitality. The room is very close to the center of Rome, it is very easy to get around. We hope to find the same host in other cities around the world !   "
31430,4217511,2013-04-19,5824231,Rafat,"Angiola's apartment is located very close to the metro and we found the location to be very convenient. The neighbourhood also has nice cafes and restaurants. The room was as described. Angiola was away when we visited but she arranged with her sister to let us in the apartment, provided information via email etc. Despite being away, she was very responsive with our questions and very helpful. 
Would definitely recommend her to the airbnb community!"
31430,4245186,2013-04-22,3355168,Robson,"Our stay in Rome was perfect! 
My wife and me liked so much the house and the location. It's a quiet and nice residencial neighborhood, easy to reach any place by subway and train.
Angiola couldn't be at home because received an urgent job, nevertheless she helped us with all the needed information and tips before our arriving. Her kindly sister received us and made ourselves at home.
The room and bathroom are very comfortable and clean.
There were two other guests in the house, who in the rare occasions we saw them were nice and kind.
Near the house there's a very nice place to eat (Le Bon Boulanger) and a small supermarket.
We highly recommend Angiola's house!

31430,4488130,2013-05-08,1829361,Birgit Anna,"Our stay in Rome with Angiola was wonderful! 
We like the apartement. It was beautifull and not expensive. It is 5 min away from metro and it takes only 7 min to station Termini. Angiola  recommended us nice places in Rom. 
"
31430,4542647,2013-05-12,3187439,Ilya,"Angiola was quite helpful not only as an B&B host, but also with planning of our stay. The B&B is in proximity of Metro (~5 min by walk). You could be on Termini station in ~ 25 min after leaving B&B.
Thank you Angiola for hospitality."
31430,4633277,2013-05-17,4989516,Angela,"We had a great time at Angiola's. She is a very kind woman with a lot of knowledge and a warm heart. She tried to help us any way she could during our holiday in Rome. My mother and I enjoyed her hospitality and her lovely home very very much. We'd love to see you again some day Angiola, thanks so much for letting us stay at your home and even letting us stay in your room when our room wasn't available yet. Not many people are so kind and warm by nature as you are. Maybe we'll meet again some day!"
31430,4784573,2013-05-26,5203204,Krishnan,"We had excellent time when we stayed in this place for three nights.......The host was very helpful and spends time with us to explain the places to visit etc.,......this place is close to the metro station .......Would highly recommend this place when you are in Rome.....   "
31430,4915688,2013-06-02,1607270,Terrence,"Having stayed at other Airbnb places, I would say that Angiola is the perfect host!!!  She is warm & friendly, very helpful in identifying & getting to all of the great places in Rome, a delightful & very knowledgeable person to talk with, very sensitive to anything that we might have wanted.
Her place is very nice & comfortable. The hot water for showers is plentiful. The kitchen has everything we needed. She has a maid who came twice a week to keep things clean. The Metro station is only a short walk â as is the train station to the airport. Supermarkets, dining places, & other shops are nearby. Thanks Angiola â hugs & kisses from Terry & Kathi !!!

31430,5004900,2013-06-07,422342,Ines,"I enjoyed so much staying at AngiolaÂ´s house!!! Her appartment is beautiful. Its very comfortable and she is adorable. She really cares about her guests! The appartment is near to all the places we should go in Rome but it is in a very peaceful area to relax after sightseeing all day long.
Whenever I return to Rome I will be delighted to stay at AngiolaÂ´s house.
Thank you Angiola!!"
31430,5096885,2013-06-12,5112415,Sandra,Angiola was kind with me and my family. She was a great guest and unfortunately she waited for us until very late at night because we lost our airplane to Rome from London. Her house is beautiful. We even  had a private bathroom.  In few words I will recommend to stay with Angiola.
31430,5208988,2013-06-18,837643,Belinda,"Angiola was a lovely host! Her flat was clean and spacious, exactly as in the photos and description. The room was comfortable and it was great having our own private bathroom! We only saw Angiola briefly as she had a last minute change of plans, but she still made sure we had everything we needed and set our table in the mornings for breakfast. It was very convenient getting into central Rome for all the tourist attractions. I highly recommend Angiola's place for your visit to Rome :)"
31430,5289890,2013-06-23,590323,Paul,"We enjoyed our stay at Anjiola's house. She had to be out of town for work and we didn not get to meet her, but she made sure all our needs were met. The room is in a pleasant part of Rome, accessible to all attractions. Thanks, Anjiola!"
31430,5861379,2013-07-20,6052734,Dan,"We had a great time. Angiola is a very gracious and helpful host, who was more than willing to give us good advice about what to see and how to travel around Rome. The flat was spacious and we felt a combination of privacy and comradireyy with the other tenants as well. The location worked  for us as it is close to a metro, many restaurants, and a train stop which leads to the airport. We had a wonderful time at Angiola's; it was a great place to stay for a traveler who can appreciate a ""homey"" feel :) "
31430,6100907,2013-07-30,5594824,Ryan,"Angiola's place is warm, welcoming and full of guests from around the world. Great location, although a little journey from the main train station (Termini). Our stay here was really comfortable - breakfast was amazing and we started our days with great conversation with Angiola and her other guests. Felt like home! "
31430,6681105,2013-08-21,4533799,Kimberly,"We totally loved our stay with Angiola!!  She was an amazing host answering our many questions as we had never visited Rome before.  Her hospitality was wonderful and we felt very much at home.  Her place was all we needed for out time in Rome which means that we needed a place to rest and have a great breakfast, and then we spent our time touring the sites.  Easy Access to all the sites by public transport trains.  We bought a 3 day pass for 16 â¬ and went easily to all the place we wanted to see.  She had internet and could easily help us with all we needed.  Thank you and we would come again"

31430,8178467,2013-10-19,9300413,Zazy,"Hi,
My stay at Angiola was wonderful though short. The apartment is pretty close to metro stop. The entire residential area sounds safe and secure. Indeed, the entire surroundings is peaceful.
Regarding Angiola, she is well-educated and art-loving personality. I found her very kind, and helpful. 
I wish to have long stay at her place.

Peace & love
Zazy"
31430,8441075,2013-10-31,4919150,Marilynn,"Angilola is a kind hostess. She has a large room and a very modern bath for room A. If you ask her she will help you find your way to any of the places in Rome you may want to see. The only down side is that her flat is in a residential neighborhood, no restaurants or shops close by and also a walk to the subway station and a ride into the center of Rome. She kindly gives directions. It can be fun to have a local experience and also to ride local transportation, you see how people in the city really live."
31430,8581596,2013-11-06,2138620,Mary Ann,This was my second time staying at Angiola's place and it was even better because I got to know the city center and the neighborhood more. The bedroom and the private bathroom are exactly what I needed for a weeklong stay in Rome. Angiola's helpful with whatever questions I may have. Coming home to the apartment after a day of sightseeing was like coming home to my own place. Grazie Mille Angiola. 
31430,8709860,2013-11-12,9865170,Lydia,"Angiola's place was lovely, as is she!  I had a very nice time in Rome and it was wonderful to have a relaxing, comfortable place to come home to at the end of the day.  The room was comfortable and exactly what I expected and the bathroom was very large and modern.  The bed could be a bit more comfortable, but it was nothing to quibble over after a long, exhausting day of sightseeing.  The location, a short walk from the metro, I found to be very convenient and safe in the early hours of the night.  I was a bit unsure at first, but there is truly nothing to fear.

Even though Angiola could not be there when I arrived, her sister greeted me and we worked our way through initial details in my extremely limited Italian.  Angiola put up with my desire to use what little Italian I know and I appreciated that immensely!  She was also kind enough to schedule a taxi pick-up for me.

Breakfast was a real treat and a great way to start the day--it was especially nice to mingle with the other guests."
31430,8826809,2013-11-19,7516184,Anthony,"Angiola's place was very clean and easy to reach with the subway, the communication has been very efficient all along the booking and during my stay, I would definitely stay there again, many thanks "
31430,9365103,2013-12-24,9457551,Joanna,Good place to stay. Good restaurant almost around the corner. It was very easy to use public transport or make a walk in the parcs. Angiola was very helpful. 
31430,9425831,2013-12-28,9911477,Seemon,"We found ourselves very lucky that we could stay in Angiola's place for this Christmas in Rome.

First of all, our flight was being delayed for two and a half hours, I was certainly got no mobile and internet access and was not able to contact Angiola. But she's been waiting for us till very late, which we were so sorry for that.

While, the apartment is located in a safe area with many local residents there. However, you can find good deli, cheap restaurants and supermarkets and shops nearby.

The apartment itself is a contemporary classic one, with artistic atmosphere. I and my hubby love it very much. The room, kitchen and bathroom were very clean, warm and spacious. We (2 adults and 1 child) found that the room size is perfect. 

Well, Angiola treats real breakfasts every morning. She is a very nice host that she would help you to search and find the places where you could go (as many things shut during Christmas). It's warm, you can feel it. Highly recommend!

Vive en un sector de la ciudad residencial, muy tranquilo. EstÃ¡ ubicado a 15 minutos de Termini. El Metro de Roma es fÃ¡cil de dominar, de modo que es sencillo llegar a la estaciÃ³n cercana al pÃ­so. Su piso, la habitaciÃ³n y el baÃ±o son muy amplios. y limpios. La recomiendo sin ninguna duda."
31430,9875297,2014-01-16,9120010,Sarah,"My husband, baby, and I loved staying with Angiola who was helpful, friendly, and very welcoming.  The accommodation was clean and comfortable. 

The neighborhood and apartment were perfect for traveling with children for the following reasons:
1.  It was very safe.
2.  It is only a few blocks from the metro which was able to take us everywhere we wanted to go.
3.  There was a park only about a 5 minute walk from the apartment with playground equipment for both younger and older children.
4.  The apartment was in walking distance to plenty of food options that allowed us to bring delicious meals to enjoy back at the apartment.  Our favorite was Le Bon Boulanger.  The apartment was also walking distance to food stores and Angiola welcomed us to cook in the kitchen as often as we liked.

Overall, we loved staying with Angiola and would recommend this apartment to anyone."
31430,9935380,2014-01-20,3488296,Jackie,"Angiola's home was a restful, welcoming base for our few days in Roma. It is situated in one of the inner suburbs of Roma, accessible to all places via the Metro and buses. At the end of a day of exploring, amidst other tourists, it was perfect to get away and feel like we were returning home.
Angiola knows and loves her city and we felt privileged to be in her home, in her company, learning from her insights about life in Roma and things of interest and beauty. She was quickly aware of our interests and helped us get there. 
She picked us up from the Metro on our arrival - that was very generous. She helped us find a great film we went to see and gave us lots of information about what was available - also very generous. She gave us her time for interesting conversations and exchanges. When we really needed to eat a home-cooked dinner, she encouraged us to use the kitchen.
Our heart-felt appreciation for all that you gave us.
Jackie and Hazel

31430,10431179,2014-02-18,11722511,Sascha,Exactly what I was expecting. Bed was comfortable and our host very friendly and informative. 5 mins from the metro. Great value for money. Next time I go to Rome I will stay here again. 
31430,10756855,2014-03-06,10423199,John,"Angiolas home felt like our second home. She helped us when we needed advice and local knowledge but was not intrusive on our privacy. Her home cooked meal was a lovely touch and gave us a chance to know more about life in rome as well as the other guests. My pasta making skills have improved although not quite up to angiolas standard yet. We would recommend staying here, all was clean and tidy, water hot and good location."
31430,11759894,2014-04-14,13410558,Amanda,"Angiola is very welcoming and charming and her apartment is located in an area where you can escape from the hustle and bustle of Rome and enjoy relative peace and quiet at night-time in your bedroom.  Angiola had to go away for a couple of days whilst we were there, but her sister and house help looked after us well in her absence.
The tube into Rome is very easy and takes only a few minutes, so it is possible to go into the city to eat in the evening as well as daytime excursions, as long as you do not want to stay out until the early hours.  There are also some good local places to eat (the best we found is called Boulanger) and many shops nearby.  
I was rather over-ambitious at booking a 16 year old into the same room as his parents and it is my fault that our room seemed a little cramped at times.  Angiola was understandably concerned when she saw the size of the third person as the  additional bed is only for smaller children.
Otherwise the room is clean and comfortable with a similar bathroom next door.  The breakfast of coffee, tea, juice, yoghurt fruit, cereal and home-made jam is also fine.

By metro or bus it's easy to visit Rome, the house is near both. Also there are excellent restaurants and ""pizzas"" in the neighborhood. 
We highly recommend staying with Angiola!!

31430,12458885,2014-05-03,1245717,Jenny,Angiola was extremely accommodating and helpful. The nearest metro station is a 5 minute walk from her place. I highly recommend her! 
31430,13140720,2014-05-20,1488497,Steven Marc,"My family and I had a wonderful stay in Angiola's lovely flat in Rome.  It is well located in a quiet and safe neighborhood north of the city centre and easily accessible by one of the metro lines.  The night we arrived, Angiola was kind enough to walk to the metro station to greet us and help us find the way to her flat.  We stayed in Room A, which was more than adequate for three people.  We had our own private bathroom with a very nice bathtub-shower combination.  Continental-style breakfasts were on our own, but Angiola provided a great variety of items for our use.  Breakfast was also a great time to get to know some of her other guests.  We had some wonderful conversations with Angiola during our stay, about Rome, about art, about many things.  She was most generous with her time and offered us countless hints on how best to make use of the limited time we had for visiting Rome.  When we return to Rome, we will plan our visit on the basis of availability at Angiola's place.  "
31430,13361961,2014-05-26,13064804,Gopal,"We stayed for 4 nights in Angiola's room A. She has a lovely apartment that is a few metro stops away from the main station in Rome (about 15 min away). She rents out all 3 rooms, but it is absolutely a wonderful visiting experience! (Meeting and conversing with other travelers and Angiola!).  

The room was clean and a great size. The bed was very comfortable and the private bathroom was extremely convenient and spacious! Every morning there was a simple, but very filling breakfast that was very nicely laid out for us. It definitely helped to get us started for the day! 

As some reviewers said before - the locks are a bit tricky. But you really just need to be patient and they work perfectly! It is comforting that she lives in a well gated apartment complex, we had no worries about safety what so ever! We were also able to lock our individual rooms, which gave us more peace of mind as well! 

We loved staying here. Even though the apartment is not walking distance to the center city - the metro stop is about 5 minutes away (10 if you have luggage) and makes traveling to and from the major sights (or anywhere accessible by metro or train) extremely convenient. Angiola is very welcoming and was extremely helpful in providing suggestions of what to do and where to go! She truly opens up her home to her guests and creates a wonderful BnB experience. 

I would definitely recommend staying with Angiola if you are visiting Rome. It is perfect for 2 people! She knows a lot about the city and is so friendly and open and willing to help her guests in any way that she can! Staying here will make your trip very comfortable as it is safe, cozy and informative! "
31430,14769122,2014-06-26,11269658,Lynda,"Location, location, location!!! My husband & I were so very lucky to have found these charming, private  accommodations.  For a full month in Rome we had the best of all possible worlds.  Angela's apt. is in a lovely safe quiet residential neighborhood, but with metro and bus lines 1 minute walk from her door.  On the way we could smell the blooming flowers everywhere.  We were in the heart of Rome ( almost every day) within 15 minutes. Our room was lovely and breezy with a very large, comfortable (real) bed.  The bath was modern with a large tub and shower! Angela is a gracious hostess who truly enjoys her guests.  Breakfast was fresh and on the table every morning waiting for us. She has a wealth of information on traveling in and about Rome and Italy and a wonderful and useful collection of books at your disposal.  While you can have as much privacy as you want, however,we interacted with other guests which added so much to our overall experience, several of whom we will remain in touch with. We plan to return next year!"
31430,15056966,2014-07-01,5399631,Carmela,"Another great night at Angiola's! It was wonderful to stay at Angiola's cheerly, local, convenient location and then at the end of our European adventures in Southern Italy, to be able to return. Angiola even offered to keep a bag at her house while I went on my excursion with a lighter load. I met other interesting travelers at her place as well and we shared tips. Angiola is great with insights and directions. She is an excellent host. 
Thank you for making our stay in Rome so lovely! Your rooms are just as pictured, clean, charming and delightful! Breakfast was wonderful and fresh. Security was great. I always felt safe and secure! 
"
31430,16182434,2014-07-22,17067311,Robert,"My two nights in Rome were very comfortable, staying at Angiola's apartment. The room was good value for the price, and Angiola is a helpful and attentive host. The apartment is centrally located and close to anything you might need. I strongly recommend this accommodation. "
31430,16349577,2014-07-26,12102373,Ulyana,"We would like to thank Angiola for our short but comfortable stay in Rome. She is very nice person, helpful and responsive, and she really cares about her guests. 
Flat is not in the center, bur it's only 3 minutes walk from underground station, and it's very convenient. Bed was comfortable (we rented room A with a private bathroom), coffee was tasty! "
31430,16749288,2014-08-01,2819934,Amit,"Angiola is the most gracious host I have come across on AirBNB, the welcome, the comfort of the place, the huge space, the cooking lesson, the breakfast, the surrounding, I will always remember Rome fondly because of this experience. Thank you."
31430,16811449,2014-08-02,6825681,Laura,Wonderful place to stay.  Very clean and welcoming.  Also close to the metro! 
31430,16857200,2014-08-03,18116485,Cara,Angiola has a beautiful home which is close the Rome metro which makes it easy to get into the cities center. The bedroom was spacious and comfortable with a fan which is nice to have when it is hot. Angiola is a very friendly lady who is very hospitable and makes sure to have people available for her guests if she isn't going to be able to be home. Great stay option!!!
31430,17006957,2014-08-05,17809166,Andreas,The stay at Angiola's was good. We had anything we wanted and the metro station is 2 minutes walkimg distance! Definitely recvomended fro holidays in Rome
31430,17147131,2014-08-08,13758854,Don,"Angiola's place in Rome has a very authentic, relaxed and friendly vibe. Her peaceful nature seems to pervade the house and we enjoyed the pleasant interactions we had with her and the other international guests. The accommodation was comfortable and very close to the Metro that took us into the heart of Rome. Angiola also very kindly printed out the tickets I purchased online for the Vatican Museums. Recommended."
31430,17585846,2014-08-14,19085382,Reza,"Staying in Angiola's apartment was a permanent memory for me and my wife. The rational behind this feeling is that, the house was and our room was so clean,peace and calm. The towels and bedsheets are clean as well. The private bathroom and shower is big and so hygienic. The breakfast provided by Angiola was also nice, complete and containing several options.
The location of apartment is good and so close to the metro station.
Last and the important point is the kindly behavior of Angiola.
If me and my wife come back to Roma again, we will definitely prefer to stay there again."
31430,17789423,2014-08-17,19200505,Clint,This is very close to a metro station and easy to travel right into the popular locations. It was quiet and very comfortable. The host had good information on places to eat and other needs. She also had a handy city walking guide that I enjoyed having on my stay.
31430,18129688,2014-08-22,18759561,Samantha,"We had a great 5 night stay at Angiola's.  It was a bit out of the center (which we knew beforehand), so we needed to take the metro to go anywhere.  This was fine, but somewhat inconvenient as the metro shuts down at 11:30 PM.  Angiola was available and willing to help us out with anything we needed. We were wondering if a certain restaurant was open, but we don't speak italian, so she graciously checked the restaurants website and made a phone call for us.  Our room was great.  We had plenty of space, and the bathroom was big as well.  The privacy was also nice.  The only trouble we had was upon our arrival.  We were only traveling for a short time so we didn't have an international phone plan or get a European phone, but Angiola had asked us to send her a message when we arrived to the metro station near her house.  (I planned on finding a nearby place with WiFi.) Our train into town ended up being delayed, so the time we had planned on meeting would no longer work but I had no way of letting her know.  The nearest WiFi ended up being a 20 minute walk! After I was able to send her a message, we were able to meet back at the station.  But this could've been avoided if we just had walking directions to her house.  It is a very short, very easy walk from the metro station, so my recommendation would be to have directions to her house from there.  But overall, we had a great stay, and I would recommend it! "
31430,18268115,2014-08-24,17374049,Marjorie,My stay with Angiola was delightful. She gave me tips on what to do and how to get around to different sights. Room was cleaned as I checked in because the previous guest checked out late. The neighbourhood is quiet and house is 5mins from Libia metro and bus stops. Would def recommend Angiola's place if you are in Rome
31430,18628393,2014-08-29,18453667,Vessela,"Lovely home and Angolia is very nice and helpful with providing directions and helping you with information about Rome. Breakfast is bread with jam, butter, yougurt, fruits, juice and coffee or tea. The room is large it gets hot unless you have a fan, the bathroom is big and everything smelled good and it was clean. I got lost coming from the airport on a regular train because they do not accounce stops(very common on older trains/metro), so i would suggest getting on the express train which costs little  more to termini and then metro B to dOro stop libia. There are couple of supernarkets around the area, meat stores, gelatos, coffee and bars you get to experience the local suburb  Italian living with no tourist around, quiet at night and only 20min from colosseo with the metro."
31430,18838306,2014-09-01,10116525,Carlinda,"I spent a weekend at Angiola's house and I could not be happier with the accommodation. I was travelling alone, so a safe location, but yet close to the centre was my main priority. Angiola's house is located in a lovely, quiet neighbourhood not far from the centre. The house was impeccably cleaned and the room just as advertised in the picture. Angiola ensured during my entire stay that I knew where to go and provided me assistance. I cannot thank enough Angiola's hospitality which helped my first visit to Italy memorable.

31430,19032754,2014-09-05,18937896,Di,Angiola is very kind and generous. She provided me everything I might need. I had also a fabulous private bathroom. The appartment is just 5mins walk from the metro station. It is quite convenient to go everywhere. Enjoy my short stay in her Angiola's appartment.  I highly recommend Angiola as a host! 
31430,19215504,2014-09-08,7334815,Alejandro,"We had a great stay at Angiola's. The location is great, really close to the metro station. It's also not as noisy as it would be in the very centre of  the city. The apartment is great and specious. We loved our bedroom and the fact that we had a private bathroom. Angiola's a really friendly person. She always prepares a nice breakfast for their guests. I'd recommend staying at Angiola's to everyone.
Thank you so much for your time!"
31430,20132184,2014-09-24,5285248,Gustav,Wir haben uns rundum sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt. Angiola ist eine sehr freundliche Gastgeberin
31430,20348528,2014-09-28,20130878,Jia,"Angiola was great as a host! Despite that she needed to be elsewhere, she made sure we are in good hands first and had everything we need. The place (e.g. Distance to metro) is as described and as shown in pictures. The neighborhood is also quiet and seems safe. We didn't have problems walking home late at night. "
31430,21077501,2014-10-11,3518791,Rue,"Really nice big room with big bathroom, clean and comfortable. Quiet. Five min. Walk to metro. Some confusion because the building can be entered and exited on two different streets, so there are really TWO addresses. That was not clearly explained and should have been. Owner was nice, as well as other guests. Overall, an excellent value for the money."
31430,21310972,2014-10-14,21950510,Liz,"Staying at Angiola's was a really good experience to kick start my airbnb journey. Angiola was a really warm and nice host who helped us with so much from picking us up from the train station to getting us a map and directing us to the places around town. Location is super convenient, not of walking distance to city but straight train. It is though, important to note that it takes approximately 10 mins walk from train station to Angiola's place so it's a little weary if you're carrying huge heavy luggages but it was worth the walk for us as we enjoyed our stay a lot. Right amount of privacy and help. Would love to return whenever I visit Roma again! Hope you enjoyed the ananas tarts Angiola! Liz & Huisi. "
31430,22015442,2014-10-28,17595792,Diane,"We had a lovely stay in Rome at Angiola's place. We felt quite at home and we appreciated the comfortable bed, the quiet neighborhood and the use of her kitchen. As well,  Angiola was generous with her time -  sharing her insights about the places to visit etc.  "
31430,24100367,2014-12-20,19937351,Samuel,"I spent two and half months at Angiola's. The room was as described, spotlessly clean, and cozily warm. Even though Angiola rents out another two rooms, her apartment is usually very quiet, especially at night. The apartment itself is located in a condo on a quiet side street, but the nearest subway station and a busy shopping street are a three-minute walk away.
Angiola is an excellent host. While respectful of her guests' privacy, she was always close at hand when I needed her and went out of her way to help me. As a long-term stayer, I regularly used the kitchen to prepare meals at night. Angiola would usually sit down and eat with me and we'd have interesting and stimulating conversations on topics ranging from politics to literature and... food. Angiola also kindly introduced me to other guests who would occasionally join us at the dinner table. I will always cherish fond memories of some of these dinners.
Overall, my stay at Angiola's has been a very positive experience. I highly recommend her to other guests.

31430,24640475,2015-01-01,9550142,Daniele,"Casa accogliente, stanza spaziosa, luminosa e bagno immacolato. Davvero una ottima esperienza. Angiola Ã¨ molto disponibile ed affabile e ci ha dato diversi consigli su come muoverci meglio a Roma. Il quartiere Ã¨ semicentrale, molto carino e ottimamente collegato.

La consiglio come host a tutti !"
31430,25183869,2015-01-08,6849821,Pauli,"I stayed at Angiola's place for seven nights in early January and was very satisfied with everything. My room was spacious, big enough for two, with nice furniture, a mural and pictures. There was a private bathroom and breakfast was served every morning, generously enought to get a man through his first few hours of trekking in the city.

The place isn't close to the centre, but the metro is just three minutes away and the main street, Viale Libia, had all the shops, restaurants and other services one could need. The area felt calm and laid back, good for evening walks in its own right.

Angiola took care of guests very professionally. She gave good tips about what to see and do, and we had wonderful conversations.

I absolutely reccomend a stay in Angiola's rooms."
31430,27081085,2015-02-24,3232599,Aaron,"Angiola is a very nice host. The room is very nice, clean and quiet. It is in a nice neighborhood in Rome (Trieste), right near the metro Libia and 12 minutes to the Colosseum. Thank You!"

31430,29289916,2015-04-06,1202274,MarilÃ©n,"Angiola es el perfecto anfitriÃ³n, nos explicÃ³ todo lo que necesitabamos y nos diÃ³ alternativas de visitas para los dÃ­as de lluvia con bebe. Nos prestÃ³ paraguas y mapas y guÃ­a de museos.

La habitaciÃ³n es tal cual se decribe, es muy amplia y luminosa, y el baÃ±o estÃ¡ reciÃ©n reformado, la baÃ±era es fantÃ¡stica.
El desayuno es bueno y suficiente.

El barrio nos encantÃ³, es muy tranquilo y con un gran parque donde poder pasear fuera del bullicioso centro de Roma. A la vez estas tan solo 12 minutos en metro del Coliseo, ideal para descansar despues de un largo dÃ­a de turismo.

100% recomendable"

Definitely recommend this place! "
31430,30038340,2015-04-16,2599642,Whitney,"We enjoyed our stay at Angiola's, it was a short walk to the metro and about 15 minutes into the city. While Angiola was out of town, her sister and friend were able to provide a lot of assistance. 

The bed was really comfortable and the room nice and sunny. We were even able to do our laundry which was great after being on the road for a bit. "

31430,30973596,2015-04-30,21244360,Laura,"La stanza Ã¨ pulita, la casa graziosa e raffinata, strategica la posizione perchÃ¨ realmente di facile accessibilitÃ  anche a chi non Ã¨ un buon camminatore, grazie alla metro molto vicina, ma il vero valore aggiunto Ã¨ la padrona di casa: deliziosa, gentile, disponibile e discreta, qualitÃ  che se dettate dal cuore, come nel caso della signora Angiola, rendono il soggiorno una visita serena e l'impatto col viaggio diventa meno brusco.  Questa Ã¨ stata la prima volta che provavo questa metodologia di sistemazione e l'ho ""rischiata"" nella forma piÃ¹ delicata, mandandoci i miei genitori 70 enni: e tutto Ã¨ stato di loro gradimento, anzi ha dato loro modo di credere nella loro indipendenza e ridimensionare la paura del viaggio-non-organizzato-in-chiassose-comitive, rivalutando il viaggio dettato dal ritmo del singolo. Consiglio a chi vuole vedere Roma questa sistemazione perchÃ¨ Ã¨ di rara qualitÃ , sia per il prezzo che per il rapporto umano dove la discrezione Ã¨ il prezioso strumento cui la padrona di casa fa sentire a proprio agio i suoi ospiti.
grazie Signora Anjola per la disponibilitÃ  e la sua gentilezza. Figli permettendo, spero di poter conoscerla di persona e beneficiare pure io della sua ospitalitÃ  attraverso questo geniale strumento che Ã¨ il circuito airbnb. le auguro una buona e felice primavera. laura"
31430,31681839,2015-05-08,21989644,Constance,Angiola is a very nice host written everything clearly so you can find the flat easily. And she would pick you up at the metro station show you how to open all the doors which is very sweet. The location is good if you want away from the noise of sights centre. But don't worry about the traffic because metro station is just 5 mins walking away and Roma is not a big city.

Angiola is so nice! I should arrive at Rome at 2pm on my schedule. But Rome airport was closed, so I needed to change flight to Milan first, then took airplane's bus to Rome airport...When I arrived at Angiola's house, it was 3am the next day. She was still waiting for me...impressive. The room is spacious and cozy, I really want to stay longer. Hope to see Angiola again.

31430,32244413,2015-05-16,29682029,Sara,"Angiola was the perfect hostess! She provided terrific (and practical) suggestions for site-seeing for my short Rome visit (one day! I must return). ""Iris"" was elegant, clean, and fresh. I found everything I needed and was so impressed with the beautiful neighborhood. Transportation to and from FCO was super easy!  "
31430,32441953,2015-05-17,23049994,Victor,Angiola is an amazing host. She was willing to let us check in at 23:30 at night as we got in late at the train station. When we arrived even later than that she was very gracious and hospitable. Her rooms are uniquely themed and the mattresses are extremely comfortable. The private bathroom seemed like a hotel and had useful amenities such as shampoo and body wash. The free breakfast the next morning was a fantastic start to the day. 
31430,32814132,2015-05-22,21853086,Caroline,"Angiola is a very special person.  From the moment I arrived, she was kind and extremely helpful.  Angiola's home is beautiful, so quiet, in a very safe neighbourhood - and less than 15 minutes on the train to the Collosseum and city centre.  

I was pleasantly shocked by how great so many things were - better than I expected about this apartment and sweet Angiola.  Every day she would help me with directions or ideas of what to do, and told me about places you just don't heaer about - all the perfect spots that are undiscoverd bylarge numbers of tourists - felt like Ihad Rome all to myself at times!

I booked Angiola for a day trip/tour of art around Rome - so amazing. Angiola chose exactly what I loved and is deeply educated on art history.

 I was blessed to find  Angiola, particularly as I had not been to Italy, or Rome before - it was such a perfect introduction for me.  I will be returning to Angiola's before I go home, in between other tours around Italy.

Angiola is incredibly respectful of your space and I never felt anything other  than competely comfortable - a Hotel would not have been as warm and such a blessed experience for me.  There were 2 other couples staying in other rooms of the apartment, but you could not hear a sound. 

I have such a great time when we went out sightseeing like taking a friend out to laugh and share stories for the day.

I hope you have the same brilliant experience that I did.  It was a miracle that I stumbled on Angiola."
31430,32939145,2015-05-23,33306573,Fairouz,Very nice and clean accommodation; moreover Angiola is a very kind host. It was nice to stay there!

The private adjacent bathroom was also spacious and very clean. The flat was super easy to get to from the train station and just as mentioned, 12 minutes via metro to central Rome. Angiola was a very kind and hospitable host, who was very accommodating and accessible with our arrival plans. She made us feel very at home and made herself very available to offer any suggestions and directions. Would definitely recommend staying here!"

Thank you so much Angiola again!"
31430,34430395,2015-06-08,20113099,Debbie,Great experience! Room is as advertised. Angiola is a kind host and takes the time to help guide you to the sites that interest you. She suggested ways to avoid crowds and see great parts of Rome. She leaves a notebook with all sorts of suggestions. We loved one of the pizza places she suggested a few blocks away. Staying with her is recommended!

Angiola herself is an amazingly friendly and extremely helpful host, constantly making sure that we were comfortable and even making the extra effort to be up early to make sure we had breakfast. She is delightful and hospitable, and I would definitely recommend others to get acquainted with her as well :) "
31430,34942373,2015-06-14,24954328,Woo Jae,Recommended B&B in Rome. The apartment is new and near the subway station. Room and bathroom is also cozy and clean.

31430,35370515,2015-06-18,12923430,Mary Cameron,"The room and bed were very comfortable, but this listing is a little misleading. It neglects to mention that it is a long way away from the center of Rome. ""12 minutes to the coliseum"" is referring to a 12 minute metro ride back into town. If that doesn't bother you then this is a good place to stay, but we were looking for something closer to town so that we could easily return to the room during the day.  Angiola was very kind and made us coffee in the morning."
31430,35551127,2015-06-20,15695854,Yvonne,"Angiola was really nice and came to meet us at the station. The neighbourhood is peaceful and quiet. It's close to a metro station and buses. The room we stayed at had a separate private bathroom (not ensuite) that was quite spacious. The room is simple but clean and there was no air conditioning, but the temperature was cool enough without it during the night. Breakfast included toast and jam, yoghurt, fruit and cereal with tea or coffee. It was very nicely laid out. There is an elevator for heavy luggage (important for 2 girls). "

The location is a bit far from the heart of the tourist attractions in Rome, but I kinda liked the fact that it was very quiet and removed from all the tourist craziness.  Angiola was also very nice and helped us with any questions we had.  "

31430,38696555,2015-07-18,29556683,Vanessa,"Angiola was an absolutely wonderful host at a truly great flat in Rome. Upon arriving, I got myself a bit lost, but Angiola was on call and made sure that I got where I was going. As a lone traveler, her attention and willingness to help was very much appreciated. The flat is located in a great spot next to the Metro, which can deliver you just about anywhere, and perpendicular to a strip of restaurants and shops that seems to go on forever. On one of my days, I walked from the flat to Villa Torlonia, a breathtaking park of gardens and paths. It was one of my favorite adventures! It's a beautiful area and an appreciated look at a less tourist ridden area of the city. I loved my stay and had a fantastic time with Rome, Angiola, the other flat residents, and of course the treat of homemade pasta! Highly recommend! Thank you for everything Angiola! :)"

When I arrived, I was immediately served a refreshment to help cool off from the hot walk over from the train station.  I was then given some advice as to how to spend my short stay, and given an incredible dinner recommendation nearby.  I would absolutely stay again!"

31430,48673015,2015-09-28,29589042,Jade,I had a pleasant experience staying with Angiola. She was a very hospitable host and met me at the metro stop near her home when I first arrived. She also let me borrow her phone charger in times of need (the ones in Italy are different). The only con about staying in this area/ neighborhood is nowhere takes credit cards and you might have trouble getting directions or help from people (it is not a very tourist friendly area). Thanks Angiola!

And the road is difficult to walk, when u with luggage, all rampways!so I can't move to a warm place. Cos I ""misread ""Angiola's message! She sent me message to tell me She should went out to take her luggage when I almost arrived Roma railway station. 
I thought I bring lots of troubles to her, coz the bad cold, I had to stayed in the bed for 2 days,just stayed in the bed and doing nothing!I said sorry to her, and she accepted!
Host was very nice, asked If I need doctor or not. Also, told me where can go out to eat.  
I didn't take underground there, so can not give comment. But for taxi, it's hard to get! And Roma's taxi drivers r not honest at all. The host called a taxi for me which one would took me to go to the airport. If I didn't check the map, the guy wanted to take more 40ero from me!!
There r some rooms for guests in this bnb apartment. If someone likes to make friends, will be good choice! 
Anyway, thank u so much for all ur help, dear Angiola!"

(I thought I woke her up at 11 something pm because I missed the train, and I was able to catch the bus back home because of her. Also, she helped phoning the metro company because the machine took my money without returning it back.) The room was clean and really lovely. The bathroom was also really nice.

I felt very safe walking around, even at night, and appreciated the easy come/go atmosphere of her home. She kindly provided coffee upon my arrival and other breakfast items. I do wish I could've spent more time with Angiola but it was a busy week for me! She is an incredible host; the room is very well represented on AirBnB photos.

Angiola's English is very proficient and is willing to engage you in conversation whenever you have questions or if you're having a coffee in the kitchen. She was quite busy with her writing while I was there but made the time to answer all my questions about where to go, how to get there and helped me out whenever I had queries about various Italian phrases I wanted to learn! More importantly though, I found Angiola to be extremely hospitable. We had many wonderful conversations about life in Italy, her work, travel, Italian culture and food. We also shared a few dinners together, which was lovely. For me, the people make a city, and Angiola definitely helped me form a wonderful perception of Rome. Grazie Mille Angiola!

Noi siamo stati nella stanza Iris, Ã¨ proprio cosÃ¬ come nel annuncio, il bagno si trova a destra della stanza, il letto molto comodo, la collazione sempre ben apparecchiata in cucina. Dopo una segnalazione mia sui rubinetti otturati in bagno a causa del calcare ha subito contattato un installatore di impianti sanitari per porre rimedio. Questo ed altro ci ha fatto sentire tutti i giorni come a casa nostra. Carissima Angiola, grazie mille per come ti sei presa cura di noi, per le diverse discussioni interessanti e tutto il resto.

And if you travel to Rome definitely stay at angiola's. The stay at her place is as good as staying with family and feeling at home. She is an absolute sweetheart, exceptionally accommodating, flexible and helpful and patience. I was extremely comfortable at her place and got more than what I expected. The place is clean and easy to reach. 10 mins from the metro station. Breakfast is good and she lets you use the kitchen which makes it so comfortable. My sincere recommendation for a simply at home experience in Rome. "

The area is quite and safe and getting into the heart of Rome is pretty simple. If you have the opportunity to stay here, do it! "
31430,87653793,2016-07-21,8210386,Lola,Angiola was really kind and patient with me. She came to pick me up at the subway station and took time to ensure I get in and out of the property with ease. She even allowed me to do my laundry when I ran out of clean clothes as a courtesy.  I would definitely recommend this place.
31430,87686837,2016-07-21,20902234,Laura,"I truly recommend this place. Angiola is very nice, helpful and reliable. The flat was fully equipped, clean and it was very comfortable staying there."
31430,88179910,2016-07-23,5540814,Pascale,"It would have been nice if she had only given us one entrance information because the first one given lead us to go up two flights of very large stairs and to the wrong building. Once we finally found the correct building, it was the lower building without a label that matched what had been given. When she answered the door after some persuasion, she was rude in saying it was our fault we couldn't find the place. The air conditioning was nice but a few more plug-ins or a power strip would have been nice since only two plugs near the bed worked and the ac took one of them to run. With a lot of stuff to carry it took awhile to get to/from the metro station. The breakfast consisted of yogurt and juice, so plan to bring more food with you or eat more later if you will be walking around a lot as most travelers do."
31430,89867703,2016-07-30,17980702,Gherardo,"Angiola super gentile e disponibile, casa accogliente. La consiglio a tutti!"
31430,90102575,2016-07-31,1370324,Yeelen,"The place was as it looked in the pictures. We stayed in two rooms the blue and yellow one, both gorgeous with a lot of light. The kitchen was very well equipped, there was even some food in the fridge for us. The neighborhood was a bit too quiet and a bit too residential but the subway was close by and easily accessible to the center of Rome in the matter of minutes. The highlight of the stay was Angiola. She's  an amazing host. She's cool artsy and curious about people. We are keeping contact with her and look forward to meeting up with her again in the near future. "

31430,92799230,2016-08-10,17350468,Cassandra,"Angiola was a wonderful host. I booked her room very last minute because of a change in my traveling plans and she was incredibly accommodating. What I needed was a place to rest my head before another full day of travel the next morning. Angiola place was perfect. Her home was welcoming, the bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom had a bathtub that I soaked in for at least an hour. I was so grateful for that bathtub especially after all the traveling I had been doing for the month. I was super tired and my muscles were sore from carrying heavy luggage. Angiola's place was a God-send. 
If I had any concerns or questions she answered promptly and with kindness. I left super early to catch my flight but I wished I could have stayed to enjoy her breakfast and a chance to connect with all the other Airbnb people staying at Angiola's. I couldn't have asked for a better experience on my last night in Rome. Thank you! "

31430,97386539,2016-08-27,30473098,Marika,"It was such nice to stay at Angiola's place. Initially I booked only 2 days at her apartment, thinking i will first try and then decide stay or not; finally i liked this place so much and my wonderful hostess that i stayed there for another 3 days. In total it truend that i stayed in 3 different rooms :) and that was little bit weird and uncomfortable for me changing rooms but thats because there was no free space for entire 3 days during his period at her house. But there is positve thing, I tried all 3 different and nice rooms, my favorite was Iris :) 
Location is not that close to city centre but it takes like 20min, by metro to get to Termini :) that is not far distance for Rome. Be sure Angiola's house is another museum and sightseing if u are arts and culture lover :)"
31430,98069547,2016-08-29,11909943,Kc&Lm,"Best place to stay in Rome. Room is very clean and its also close to the subway.
i would definately hire this room again if i visit Rome."
31430,100394171,2016-09-09,23204353,Simin,Angiola was a fantastic host and I loved staying at her place.  She was more than willing to help with suggestions on places to go and sites not to miss.  I left my sweater there by accident and she was so helpful in me getting it back after I left.  The location was perfect and I didn't have any problems getting to all the major sites from her place.  I had a blast in Roma!
31430,100432258,2016-09-09,16448951,Jim,Well appointed room in a convenient quite area of Rome. The host was very welcoming and extremely helpful even for my brief stay.  
31430,101330349,2016-09-12,58742167,Andrew,"My wife and I stayed at Angiola's wonderful apartment for 3 days in September. We have only good things to say about it! Good location: it is close to the Metro and bus, not far from city center, but still quiet and peaceful. Good room: the room had its own private bathroom across the hall. Room itself had a high ceiling and window overlooking a street 3floors below. Wifi in apt! Good host: Angiola was friendly and respectful of privacy during our stay. She made us delicious coffee and prepared a great breakfast spread for each morning.

We would love to stay here again!"

We came with a car and we can totally recommend everyone who is planning to do the same, as there is a parking space. The apartment is close to the metro and it's very easy to get to the centre. Angiola also prepared a nice breakfast :) very much recommended, I will definitely come again whenever I'm back in Rome! "

31430,134468603,2017-02-27,13178481,Vanessa,Angiola is a great host and I had a comfortable stay in her apartment. The apartment is close to public transport which takes you to the city centre in a few minutes. The neighbourhood also hosts a number of nice cafÃ©s and places to eat.

Breakfast was served every morning with pretty table layout and Angiola is always there for advice as she used to work as a tourist guide and has excellent knowledge of history and art."

31430,149825517,2017-05-06,10064098,Linny,Angiola was very kind and helpful during our stay in Rome. Everything was as expected and written clearly on her room description.

Breakfast of yogurt, toast, fruit, and coffee was provided in the morning. There was a guide in our room for the area, along with recommendations. Easy walk to the metro station. However, it was a little further away from downtown Rome than I anticipated. That was the only downside. Still highly recommended though! "
31430,152629183,2017-05-17,2986407,Olaf,"I would recommend living in the flat of Angiola.
3 minutes to Metro . 4 minutes to one of the best Restaurants of Roma. 
Just ten minutes from Termini, perfect. I love it

31430,153544926,2017-05-21,75223937,Alessandro,"Ottimo soggiorno. Angiola Ã¨ stata molto cordiale e disponibile. La camera Ã¨ ampia e confortevole. La zona, silenziosa e tranquilla.

The pictures are very accurate, the room is actually large. Everything was clean and tidy.
Talking about the location, it was not as far from the city centre as I had expected. If you are a walking person/OK with public transport, it won't be a disaster for you. I arrived on a strike day â nothing could ruin my journey.
Angiola and her friend are wonderful people to have a conversation with!
I am looking forward to see them again!
Thank you!"
31430,162096047,2017-06-19,60549350,Marina,Our stay at Angiola's was short but absolutely amazing. The apartment was clean and very home-y.

31430,177039408,2017-08-01,116040431,Moe,"For anyone travelling to Rome, Angiola's place is perfect. Location is quiet and the metro is less than a 5 minute walk + a 15 minute journey into Rome itself. She was VERY helpful and catered to all my needs. It was like having my mum in the house. I wish you all the best Angiola and I hope to visit you again!  "
31430,178002064,2017-08-04,85894883,Amanda,"Angiola is such a sweetheart! I didn't get to meet her sister, but she was there to greet me and see me off to the airport. She also sets the table for breakfast every morning. I visited Rome in the middle of a heat stroke, so it was pretty hot in the flat, but it's well ventilated with windows and a balcony. "

31430,183151707,2017-08-16,27771482,Thomas,"Die Unterkunft bei Angiola war wie beschrieben im Text. Das Haus liegt nicht inmitten der Touristengegend, jedoch ist es direkt Ã¼ber Zug- oder Metroanbindung zu erreichen, die Umgebung ruhig, mit EinkaufsmÃ¶gichkeiten versehen und man kann das italienische Leben spÃ¼ren. 
Angiola war unglaublich freundlich, hat sich Zeit fÃ¼r uns genommen um nette, nicht Ã¼berlaufene und trotzdem sehr schÃ¶ne PlÃ¤tze in Rom zu empfehlen. 
Man kann nur sagen, dass Ihre Tipps genial sind!

Vielen Dank fÃ¼r den schÃ¶nen Aufenthalt! Wir konnten Rom genieÃen und kÃ¶nnen uns vorstellen wieder zu kommen!"

We had a private room and bathroom, the kitchen was shared with other guests, but there was enough room for everyone.
Angiola offered us a nice breakfast in the moring. The metro station is only 5 minutes away and it's a 10 to 15-minute-ride to the colloseum and other sights. We would stay here again if we come back to Rome!"

Das kommunikative Zentrum der Wohnung ist morgens die groÃe KÃ¼che, wo man gut frÃ¼hstÃ¼cken und sich mit anderen netten Mitbewohnern, aus aller Welt, austauschen kann.

31430,207049895,2017-10-28,12218925,Garrett,"This was my 3rd time for Rome. You need to ask yourself what youâre looking for and how good you are about using transit. The place is in Rome. Yes, but far out by Rome standards. 30 minutes to the Vatican via taxi. Not sure about public transit. Probably faster? All Iâm saying is. If this is your first time in Rome. Stay closer to the center. Rome is crazy small and easy to walk around. Being in the center just gets you a head start. With that being said. There are a lot of fashion shopping in the area and it has its know charm. Kinda depends on what youâre looking for. This probably didnât help. Kisses. Caio"
31430,208853138,2017-11-03,109117176,Petra,"Ich war mit meinen beiden SÃ¶hnen Ã¼ber das Allerheiligenwochenende bei Angiola. Die Lage ist fÃ¼r Kurzurlaube perfekt, da man sofort zufuÃ bei der U - Bahn ist und in wenigen Stationen die Innenstadt errreicht hat.

31430,214247991,2017-11-25,153855145,Pauline,"I stayed with Angiola for about a week and the room perfectly suited my needs. It was spacious and clean with plenty of wardrobe space, a bathroom right next door and even an electric kettle to enable me to make my own tea! Angiola was kind, welcoming and very discrete. The apartment is very well located - just 5 minutes from Libia station on the main B metro line.  There was a file in my room with all kinds of advice on where to go and what to do, and although I did not need it, it was certainly informative. I would certainly recommend Angiola's apartment as a base for visiting Rome particularly as I found it to be very good value for money.  Thank you Angiola!"
31430,216888347,2017-12-06,157172072,Ahmed,Clean room and clean private bathroom. Exactly as advertised. Very friendly host. Less than 5 minute walk from the nearest metro station and about 2 minutes from the nearest bus stop.
31430,218809997,2017-12-15,142780782,Giovanni,Servizio Perfetto. La camera Ã© davvero molto bella e confortevole. Consigliatissima

31430,224510865,2018-01-03,103859784,Benedetta,"Stanza accogliente, molto pulita e con bagno privato in zona ben servita da negozi e mezzi di trasporto. La linea B della metropolitana Ã¨ a circa 5 minuti a piedi e consente di raggiungere il centro in poche fermate. 
Angiola Ã¨ una host accogliente e la sua âguidaâ ai luoghi da visitare e ristoranti dove mangiare Ã¨ stata di immensa utilitÃ  e molto apprezzata! 
Consiglio a tutti di soggiornare da Angiola!"
31430,232513783,2018-02-05,25856891,Ben,"5 minutes walk from the metro, on the direct line to Termini and the centre. Angiola is a great host, emailed straight away, breakfast laid out in the morning. Clean room & bathroom. Perfectly placed for me and well priced. Would stay again."
31430,234607617,2018-02-13,171405339,Bernhard,"Eine reine Wohngegend mitten in Rom, dafÃ¼r erstaunlich ruhig. Man ist tatsÃ¤chlich mit der Metro in wenigen Minuten in der Innenstadt, ein optimaler Ausgangspunkt um Rom zu erkunden. Sehr kompetente und entgegenkommende Gastgeberin."
31430,243828652,2018-03-17,41307588,Ayelen,"It was my first time in italy and the location makes my stay easy, because it is everything near and the metro is a few steps from the appartament  so you can go to the heart of roma by 12 minutes Angiola it is a super host, she helps you in whatever you need, you just have to ask her. Thank you angiola I will never forget you and your house !:)"

31430,247367561,2018-03-28,141965524,Maria Isabel,Angiolaâs place is very welcoming and warm. I loved the room and it was great to have my own bathroom! Angiola is very nice and kind. Highly recommended!

31430,250237959,2018-04-04,101250828,Melissa,"Angiola is an amazing host who really puts in care and effort. From the instructions on getting to her, to creating a guide which contained details on landmarks, maps, museums, attractions and restaurants around Rome, she is what I look for in a host. Lest I forget, she also makes breakfast for her guests every morning! Angiola provided us with a very cute room which was clean, had fantastic WiFi service, and was close to the metro as well as several local restaurants."
31430,250780976,2018-04-06,23871087,Kristen And Matthew,Angiola was the perfect hostess. She was very communicative (in English) and very very helpful. The place is conveniently located near the Metro which was important to me. The breakfast was a nice touch. Highly recommended for Rome travelers.
31430,257485551,2018-04-26,178975176,Marko,"I was with my wife and our daughter for 5 nights at Angiolaâs apartment (IRIS room) after reading a lot of positive reviews, comments and even superlatives about the service, conditions and her attitude. Angiola was indeed polite and friendly, after introducing the flat and our room, she showed us some places on the map, which we wanted to visit and explained us how to get there. However we were not very satisfied with the conditions and the service that she offered, because (I would like to make a remark here that none of us is very pretentious and I will try to be maximal objective in order to avoid any negative experience in the future with misleading information):
1. The bed, where my daughter was supposed to sleep (camp bed) was under the window that was not closing properly and there was non-stop an airflow. In a result of that my daughter caught a cold and I swapped with her.
2. The double bed was also not very comfortable because of falling through in the middle.
3. The handle of the bathroomâs door fell down during closing, but Angiola took measures and in two days it was fixed.
4. The breakfast was very unpretentious even modest, e.g. some fruits (orange and banana), bread, butter and some very small cups jam/marmalade. Nothing in common with generous Italian breakfast as mentioned in some of the previous comments and reviews. This was absolutely misleading information!
5. And other smaller disadvantages like: the furniture was quite old, blistered paint on the wardrobes, drops of white paint everywhere, curtains not moving or hardly moving, if you touch the walls, spots of plaster of white lead remain.
There was a shared kitchen as described and another table for two on the balcony. I just wonder what will happen if the guests from all three rooms decide to have a breakfast at the same time, there will be no enough place for all.
Angiola should think about how to improve the service and the conditions, otherwise will not be competitive to the market."
31430,259977161,2018-05-03,59510541,Lily,"Angiolaâs place was absolutely fantastic. Her home is beautifully designed, big enough that we always felt that we had our own space amidst other guests, and very clean and tidy. Location is a very quick walk to the metro station that was only a few stops from all the main sights in Rome, and we enjoyed the quietness of a residential neighbourhood versus the busy, touristy center. Angiolaâs hospitality was a highlight throughout our stay. My friend and I had originally booked 3 nights in the Iris room but by the time we arrived in Rome our plans had changed and we were looking for accommodation for an additional 3 nights. Angiola immediately looked through her calendar and made arrangements for us to stay at her place for the duration of our visit, even offering her own room if need be. We had to move rooms a couple times and each time she made sure the new room was sparkling clean for us, while ensuring our time in Rome wasnât affected by coordinating logistics - she took care of it all. Angiolaâs kind hospitality, delicious breakfasts and detailed suggestions on where to visit in Rome made our stay a delightful visit. Thanks again Angiola!"
31430,264897270,2018-05-15,30662774,Jason,"Angiola was very accommodating and her check in instructions were easy to follow. When following her directions and on the right side of the street, her place is AFTER the public stairs. Metro will take you to most of Rome but you will need to do a bit of walking."
31430,265473383,2018-05-17,64677811,Ramona,"This is a little outside central Rome, but the house is so close to the Metro stop that it was convenient to get wherever we were going. The apartment complex was peaceful and the neighborhood had plenty of very good cafes and restaurants. 

Angiola was a very gracious host and the apartment itself was clean and comfortable. I'd absolutely stay here again!"
31430,271446083,2018-06-01,167089842,Joan,The accommodation was outstanding.  Angiola was an outstanding host who saw to every need of her guests. She was always available to provide information and tips. Having breakfast with her other guests forged new friendships and allowed for the exchange of information. The location was ideally situated. We would highly recommend Angiola and her accommodation and would definitely stay with her again .
31430,278886720,2018-06-19,134704122,Peg,Angiola's place is immaculate and the bed was very comfortable and her knowledge of Rome is impressive. Best espresso we had in Rome!
31430,282061246,2018-06-26,94973663,Jorge,"I loved the place,  very clean, nice host but too far from the airport, 70 euros."
31430,296674431,2018-07-26,149439492,Andrea,Angiola is a very kind and friendly landlord. Her flat is a cozy home and I loved the style of my room so much! Her place is well connected with the City Center and easy to reach. I stayed there for 4 weeks can highly recommend her place :-) thank you so much for that fantastic stay! 
31430,302809636,2018-08-06,13159142,Elisabeth Christine,"I was in Rome for work and my stay with Angiola could not have been more perfect! Angiola greets you warmly, makes you feel at home and has such sincere care for her guests. She is warm and kind, and I will keep fond memories of our conversations about art and culture. 
Location is very well situated. Calm, but close to the metro that takes you quickly to the Colosseum. 
Without a doubt I would recommend staying at Angiolaâs casa.

Would gladly recommend Angiola's home to anyone whom is visiting Italy. "
31430,313832807,2018-08-26,20025437,Chrystal,"Angiola's place in Roma off the Libia metro station was exactly what we needed - a comfortable private bed & bath with air conditioning so we could rest our head after busy days exploring the city. The house is conveniently located by metro & bus. Angiola was so sweet, greeting us upon arrival, offering up breakfast in the AM, and providing a little guide book of things to eat, see and do. The warm touches were much appreciated! "
31430,318978667,2018-09-05,1309540,Cecilia,"Angiola is a very gracious host. She is very helpful and  have lots of tips on where and what to see.

31430,320623137,2018-09-09,192913634,Valerie,"Angiola  was a wonderful warm hostess.  We arrived in the afternoon, unpacked, she gave us a description of the neighborhood and we walked about. We went to dinner at the place she described and got a real feel for the neighborhood and local life. We did see some sights in Rome and enjoyed the area. The metro was very close and easy to get to. Thanks for all your help Angiola!"

31430,325688476,2018-09-20,43877418,Maribel,"Angiolaâs place was great. We loved her room and got to enjoy Netflix when we arrived from a long day out. The apartment was a bit difficult to find on the first night as we got there pretty late so it was dark. Thereâs 2 different ways to get there, and the first time we used our GPS because we were a bit confused on finding our way. The option Angiola gives is much easier, so listen! I also had my luggage lost on our first day in Rome and Angiola helped me get it back. We stayed a little longer than expected because of this delay but she was nothing but gracious."
31430,326908567,2018-09-23,108930967,ErÃ©ndira,A nice person who enjoys to meet people ;)
31430,330953577,2018-10-01,169187516,Wm Li,"The best part about staying here is Angiola's thorough knowledge of Rome and of getting around in Rome on public transport. The location of the apartment is near enough to important sites but far enough away to be out of the tourist crush but within a short walk to metro and bus. Besides, she herself is a gem! You will enjoy!"
31430,331618100,2018-10-03,160214677,Shawn,Angiola goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome and at home.

31430,335514387,2018-10-12,172880439,Abby,"Rome is a hustle and bustle city... crazy at times but so worth the visit.  We enjoyed our stay here so much!  Comfortable, quiet and clean.  There are stairs, but there is a lift to get to the apartment.  There are stairs everywhere in Rome... so just be aware that depending on where you are, there can be some stairs to climb to get to the door... but I cannot praise this host enough.  Book and enjoy!"

Iâd particularly reccomend this place for artists and writers, she has an incredible knowledge of the arts (and is willing to share her red wine!). Thanks Angiola for making my time in Rome so wonderful!"

Breakfast was ready every single morning and I was able to get anything I needed during the days I stayed. Angiola was very kind and helpful, recommending places to visit, restaurants, and ways of transportation. Her hospitality was uncanny, she will make you feel like home. I will definitely come back to her place in my next visit to Rome.
Thank you so much for everything Angiola!!"

31430,368602027,2019-01-07,83055974,Hanna,"Angiola's flat was well decorated, spacious and in a great location! We benefited from the large windows and natural light, it made the vacation that much more peaceful. We loved being so close to the metro, & our trips to and from the airport were inexpensive by train. Plus, we were walkable to so many chic cafes and clothing boutiques! She gave excellent directions and made us feel right at home. Before the trip we had many questions, and she easily helped us with logistics and expectations. It was an added surprise to have toast,  jam and plates set up every morning. Between Angiola's good humor and warm personality, and all of the recommendations she had to offer us, we could not have asked for more!! She is a wonderful, cool person with so much to offer! Enjoy Rome to the fullest with Angiola!"
31430,403550647,2019-01-21,86828140,Sarah,Angiola is very sweet and accommodating. She made me coffee as soon as I arrived and this room is very cute and comfortable.

Gentilezza, disponibilitÃ , generositÃ  e riservatezza sono gli ingredienti per passare qualche giorno di relax. . La sua casa Ã¨ sempre aperta per ospiti e amici. Un crocevia di lingue ed esperienze tenute insieme da una eccellente âpadrona di casaâ. La colazione Ã¨ preparata con cura, molto sobria. Grazie Angiola, tornerÃ² presto a trovarla in quello che considero il mio buen ritiro. Simona"
31430,417169842,2019-02-26,41604123,Stephan,"The best part of the stay with Angiola is the location, just a five minute walk from an important metro station. Next was the breakfast, just what we needed, nothing fancy but just enough to start the day.  The location makes this one of the best places in Rome. Metro will take you everywhere. But, staying with Angiola is like staying in a boarding house. Three bedrooms with guests actively enjoying and exploring Rome, all on different schedules, and with a house cleaner and her two small children active in the morning. A bit too hectic but most guests shrug and say âThatâs OK, the price of the rooms makes up for a lot.â Our room had a good, clean, private bath, but with an ancient shower, but we adjusted to it. Angiola was more than helpful, willing to do whatever was needed to help make her guests enjoy Rome, and she knows more about Rome than guide books will ever tell you. She is a super hostess.thank you Angiola."

The room was very beautiful, and Angiola made sure there were many amenities to make the stay comfortable. We enjoyed talking with her, and we really appreciated the breakfast she provided.

31430,453642764,2019-05-16,238926417,Manoharan,"This is our 3rd Airbnb stay in our 20 day euro trip and this is the best one of all. She is thoughtful in taking us through garage in lift so we don't have to carry bags in stairs, showing us the tour of the house, explaining each details. And her interest in making guests see non touristy places around the house helps get a real feel of Rome. Overall a splendid stay. This is precisely what one should seek for in an Airbnb stay. A host who is the master of the city, who is kind, who is more than willing to be either a guide for you or help you plan your day wise activity."
31430,455074677,2019-05-19,201176045,Christian,Great place to stay in Rome near a metro that basically makes getting anywhere easy and she is a great host. She even offers tips on where to go and knows the city very well would reccomend to any one visiting rome.
31430,467157724,2019-06-10,54199871,Alison,Don't hesitate to choose this special home. Our room was roomy and clean. Bed comfortable and chairs relaxing. Angiloa was a wonderful host with breakfast available each morning. Be sure to ask Angiola for a private tour starting at the Priscilla Catacombs and ending at St. Agnes Church. Very close to the easy to use metro.
31430,469329555,2019-06-14,230551986,Karin,"This was a wonderful place to stay.  Our live in host Stephan was really great and was always available. We had some really great conversations.  My room ""Iris"" was beautiful, full of light and very relaxing.  The place was not located in comfortable walking distance to any of the main features of Rome, but it was super close to the Metro that took you to any number of them and easy to use.  There was a small breakfast set out every morning at 8:00am.  I was also able to leave my bags behind for the day (after check out) since I had a later fight.  It was quiet yet I met some very nice other travelers in the house to exchange conversation with.  I highly recommend this accommodation and especially the ""Iris"" room."
31430,471814686,2019-06-18,198073622,Sara,"Amazing place. Stefan was a great host, we really loved our stay in Rome! Thank you!"
31430,475533603,2019-06-24,83625785,John,A quite neighbourhood unknown to tourists... a quick walk to the LIBIA metro station which gets you every fast (including the train station)... just a lovely place I intend to book again.
31430,480244284,2019-07-02,9895632,Olga,"I really liked my stay at Angiolaâs place!
My room was big with AC and private bathroom. Breakfast was served every morning. The apartment is close to metro station, which is very convenient to get anywhere you want in Rome.
Angiola is very friendly and a great host.
While she was gone Stefan was hosting the place and he was great as well.
I would recommend Angiolaâs place to anyone.
Great stay!"

Her place is clean an comfortable and so unique! And the location is away form the city noise in a quiet neighborhood. I strongly recommend her place for everyone."

Highly recommend!"
31430,497245780,2019-07-28,49632007,Ale,Angiola's place is very beautiful and the room space is big. The apartment is just a few blocks away to the metro station and that metro takes you to the most turistic places. Yo will be in the Colosseo in just 10 minutes. Also Angiola is very fast with her responses and help you with any need.  I definitely recommend this place.

Nice decoration and absolutely makes you feel like you actually live at home.
This is one of the option i would like to recommend to whoever wants a nice and affordable place in Rome. I'm sure you'll like it!
Good luck! :)

31464,178854,2011-02-06,365637,Pamela,"Mario was a genuine welcoming host. His home is beautiful and a perfect place to stay while touring Rome. He and his friend were available when needed, but otherwise left his home to be enjoyed. He provides all the ""comforts of home"" in a great location in a typical Italian neighborhood. "
31464,191814,2011-03-03,393405,George,Nice apartment and convenient to metro.  There is no breakfast.  Bedroom wall was not well insulated so quite noisy.
31464,198460,2011-03-14,273023,Doryann,"Marioâs home is a great place to stay in Rome.  Worth every Euro we spent, and then some!  My husband and I loved our stay.

Some highlights of Mario's home worth mentioning:

â¢	His apartment is a block away from the Monti Tiburtini stop on the Metro Line B and a stop for several bus lines.  Very convenient location for getting around Rome
â¢	Mario responds very quickly to emails and is very accommodating and easy to work with.  Great communication.
â¢	There are many shops right around his apartment; you will find everything you need for your stay.  Local shopkeepers are friendly and were very patient and helpful with our attempts to speak Italian.
â¢	Apartment has Wi-Fi access and Mario allows you to use his desktop computer
â¢	Lovely balcony for having coffee in the morning or a glass of wine at the end of the day.  
â¢	Mario left us plenty of food for breakfast, and a bottle of wine.
â¢	The bed is very comfortable
â¢	Apartment is immaculate and beautifully decorated, yet very welcoming and comfortable.
â¢	Kitchen is spacious with a full-sized gas cook top and stove.  There is a washing machine, but no dryer.  Clothes are dried on a clothesline on the balcony.
â¢	Great selection of Italian music to listen to each night.  No television.
â¢	Building is in a quiet, clean complex and has an elevator.

Two things you should know before you come (but should not at all discourage you from coming!)

â¢	Marioâs apartment is good for smokers or non-smokers who donât mind a very faint odor of smoke.  (Open a window and the breeze gets rid of the odor immediately.  It's really not a problem at all.)  
â¢	Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper; the neighbors rise early and you can hear their conversations through the bedroom wall.

We think Mario's home is fabulous.  Such a great value.  Much more comfortable than staying in a hotel.  I hope to stay there again on my next visit to Rome.
"
31464,201636,2011-03-17,402336,Jessica,"We loved staying with Mario! He was the best host. Our room was comfy. His home is amazing, filled with great art (his own sculptures) We used the  kitchen to cook, we felt like we were at home. Can't say enough good things about Mario and our stay in Rome!"
31464,209817,2011-03-27,379721,Andrea,"We had a great time in Roma, enjoying the city and romantic evenings at Mario's appartment (wine and candles were ready for us!). Mario's place is definitly praticle to discover the city and very comfortable, on physical and esthetical way (the appartment is a masterpiece of art by himself). 
Mario was very helpfull (you can ask him whatever you want: he know it!) and totaly discret (we never crossed him during our stay). On a ""distant"" way, Mario really took care of us, with many great intentions as a welcoming bottle of wine, a fridge with all we need for a delicious breakfast...
So, to conclude: we definitly  recommand Mario's home!
"
31464,214828,2011-04-01,250754,Mike,"Mario was a fantastic host and really opened his home to us. His apartment is sophisticated and charming, and we loved his decor. He's a very talented artist. He was waiting for us upon arrival at the metro stop, a kind gesture we didn't expect. He was extremely helpful and answered any questions we had. We enjoyed our stay at Mario's and would gladly return. Thanks again Mario! - Mike and Cori"
31464,259495,2011-05-11,469095,ArtÅ«ras,"Mario's place is awesome. There are so many interesting things and books, it's like one more museum of Rome. :) Breakfast was great, Italian wine also. 

Metro stop is near, so we haven't problems to get to the centre of Rome. I think Mario and his place was one of the best things in Rome. Another was an ice cream.:)"
31464,264731,2011-05-15,196398,Josh,"Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Mario as he had to leave on a business trip, however this was not a problem and his partner looked after us very well! Mario's home is amazing, very beautifully decorated and the bedroom is large and spacious with a comfy bed. The location is great - very non-touristy which is a very welcome change, and only 2-3 stops from the main Roma Termini. then you will be at the apartment in about 3-5 minutes on foot. I would highly recommend Mario's place."
31464,270585,2011-05-19,478115,Shirley,"We stayed at Mario's home for two nights late in May.  It was great! Nice livinging room, comfortable bedroom, kitchen and even access to a computer!   What more could you ask, except to stay a little longer.   Just a short walk from the Metro, the apartment was very comfortable and even had a little balcony with a table and chairs where we could enjoy the lovely bottle of wine he left for us.  

Before our trip, we contacted Mario many times to ask questions about getting around in Rome, finding his apartment, the amenities, etc. and he was very helpful and always responded very quickly.  We would highly recommend staying at Mario's home."
31464,272961,2011-05-21,382977,David,"Mario is a class act.  He was unable to be there when we were in Rome but made sure that we were taken care of by his friend.   His place was simply terrific.  The location was literally about 100 meters from the train station and the people in the neighborhood were very friendly.    There is no question that when we come back to Rome, this is where we want to stay.  Thanks again, Mario ( and also Maura his friend)"
31464,277765,2011-05-23,244308,Maria,"We had a wonderful stay at Mario's bnb. The design is fantastic, the area is quiet, yet easily accesible by metro and only a few stops from Termini train station, and a welcome bottle of wine was a nice touch too. Thank you for a lovely stay in Rome, our friends are hoping to stay at your place too. "
31464,280290,2011-05-25,434989,Donna,"Mario's apartment was perfect! The only unfortunate part was that Mario was away and we didn't get to meet him. He kindly arranged for a friend to let us in. She was there on time and and made us feel very welcomed. We found a bottle of wine that Mario had left for us along with some breakfast goodies. Much more than was necessary to make us feel at home.The apartment is very comfortable and close to the metro, which makes traveling in Rome very easy. I would highly recommend Mario's apartment."
31464,283155,2011-05-27,215176,Jiahui,"What an excellent flat! The entire place was very well decorated, airy, and came with a balcony. Mario's jazz collection was also very wonderful. Mario provided us with everything we possibly needed and more! The location is just a 5 min walk from the metro, and there are buses that will drop you off from the city center as well. This was one of our favorite places we stayed at during our trip to Italy. Thank you so much, Mario!"
31464,287274,2011-05-30,376159,Nevena,"I highly recommend Mario's place! Me and my husband stayed there in the last days of May and we really enjoyed everything. 
Here is what we loved about it:

1. ATMOSPHERE. It has a unique artistic atmosphere, very cozy and intimate, very relaxing, everything is arranged with a lot of taste, as you can see from the photos. it is nothing like being in a hotel. Even the bathroom is a piece of art. We immediately felt at home.

2. FACILITIES. Mario is a great host. He has provided us with absolutely everything we needed for our stay. We used practically all premises and facilities - not only the bedroom, but also the living room, the balkony and the kitchen. There is also free internet available. 

3. LOCATION. The apartment is located in a nice resident quarter, in a contemporary Italian neighborhood - very green, calm and charming.  Outside there is a big garden with lots of trees and you can hear nightingales in the dark. It was fantastic! You can buy Italian food, wine and vegetables from the near-by little stores. Unlike the most touristic places and Termini, you can see how this place is very quite and tranquil.

4. TRANSPORT. It is easy to get there - although it seems a little far from the center of Rome, you can get there in 10 minutes with the metro - at Termini get the line B to Monti Tiburtini station. The first metro starts in 5.30 am and the last is in 11.30 pm for Line B. 
NB. Mind that Line A closes in 9 pm, because there is construction going on.

In two words - it is a lovely place!"
31464,295465,2011-06-03,465413,Leannda,"Our stay at Mario's was incredible.
He has a beautiful apartment, close by a metro station, and he vacated the entire apartment for us during our stay.
Mario's apartment is decorated in his own artwork, which is just beautiful. A basket of provisions was left for our comfort, along with excellent instructions and the freedom to use the whole apartment as we wished. The apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable.
Mario himself was a wonderful host and an absolute pleasure to meet and deal with. His communication with us before and after the trip was prompt and easy.
I would love to stay in Mario's apartment again if ever I was back in Rome, and would happily invite him to come stay with us if ever he needed a place in Australia!
Book this place in - you won't regret it."
31464,299547,2011-06-06,480688,Bastien,"We had a great stay in Roma. Mario was great and helpful. The appartment is very nice, spacious and well located.

31464,328307,2011-06-22,569932,Todd,"Lovely stay in, not immediately central to, Rome.  Metro a few stops (15 minutes) to a lovely apt. in a large apt bldg.  3 blocks from a park with kid friendly games, but this space is too well appointed for young kids.  Only 2 blocks from subway, in the middle of a very Roman neighborhood, complete with grocery, banks, pharmacy, great pizzerias, hardware store (ferramenta), flower store, and all the other shops expected along an urban street in an urban neighborhood.

Mario's place is very nice, has clothes washer and internet connected computer. B Mario is a sculpter, chef and collector of kitsch.  Lovely apt with balcony.  Citrus press, espresso maker, bottle of wine, were lovely additions to the urban balcony, separate bedroom, breakfast foods.  Mario met us at the nearby metro stop and was a wealth of information about local stuff and a very kind person who wanted to help in any way he could.  He no longer lives in the 2nd bedroom (locked) and stayed with girlfriend nearby (but was very connected via phone).

Absolutely lovely stay with Mario. Would recommend highly to anyone staying in Rome with kids over, say, 10 yrs old - And anyone who appreciates Italy for what it is - an exploration of who we all were 2000 years ago, who we would like to be, and who we would not like to be.  Rome is great - Mario's is a great place to see Rome from and still relax.

MUCH better than any hotel stay. "
31464,331113,2011-06-24,375286,Claire,"Great place to stay, and Mario is a lovely host. Close by to the local metro station and great cafes and supermarkets. Grazie Mario!"
31464,341857,2011-06-29,213289,Jeffrey,"Accommodation - This tastefully decorated apartment is very neat & tidy and well-equipped with basic amenities. Location: The area has a few inexpensive cafes and it is a 5-minute walk from the metro. Host: Mario is a warm and friendly host. He made sure that our stay was very comfortable and promptly answers all questions. Tips for travellers: This place is great for neat & tidy travelers that want to stay in a non-touristy and tranquil neighbourhood. Conclusion: I highly recommend Mario's place, as it has been a great highlight to our vacation in Rome."
31464,347597,2011-07-02,599604,Anette And Syvert,"Staying with Mario was amazing. He is the greatest host, friendly and easy going and he really opened up his home for us. He had arranged for breakfast for us. We could cook dinner if we wanted - the flat were ours in every way! 
Sharing a bottle of wine on his balkony was always a great way to end the day. 
We stayed with him for three nights and if we ever go back to Rome we would definitly stay with him. 
"
31464,360558,2011-07-08,676881,Amy,"My boyfriend and I had a comfortable stay at Mario's apartment. Mario welcomed us to a basket full of breakfast foods and a fridge stocked with juice and eggs. We did not end up cooking, but the effort was much appreciated. Having air conditioning and Internet access was also a huge plus. Mario's home is easily accessible by the Metro, but the Metro is not so reliable (there are only two lines and the train stops are somewhat far from some sites). For a short stay, I would probably stay somewhere more central next time, but for an extended stay in a home-like environment full of interesting objects and art, I would definitely recommend Mario's!"
31464,384997,2011-07-20,151977,Miyuki,"We had lovely staying in Roma. Unfortunately we could not meet Mario but his partner treated us very nicely and gave us very useful information. Everything in the flat was set up perfectly. The apartment was very nice, I loved the taste of his decorating. The place was close from local metro station though easy access to every tourist spots. We enjoyed much to stay his place."
31464,388438,2011-07-22,553938,Ching,"Mario got his partner Maura to meet us at the metro and showed us the apartment. We had the apartment to ourselves, and had a good time. We felt at home at Mario's, and enjoyed the food and drinks he set out for us. Thanks Mario and Maura!"
31464,419023,2011-08-04,647053,Farah,"Mario was out of town while we were in Rome so we never met. His partner was there to greet us and we had the apartment to ourselves. The space is artsy and relaxing and great for a couple. Mario also left a bottle of wine for us which was very thoughtful.

The apartment is extremely close to the metro (Line B), although not necessarily close to tourist sites. It's only about a 10 minute ride to most tourist destinations within Rome, though the metro does stop running around 01:30 or so."
31464,427660,2011-08-08,602137,Claire,"Mario was the perfect host. Even though he was not there during our time in Rome, he took care of us from afar. He is very responsive to all questions and genuinely welcomes you into his home. "
31464,465047,2011-08-22,596910,Seamus,"Mario and Maura were incredibly hospitable, welcoming, helpful and friendly.  The apartment is beautifully decorated, and we had full access to the kitchen and bathroom, and were even provided with a light breakfast!  The bedroom is beautiful and - very importantly - air-conditioned.  It is a short walk to shops and the metro, and only 6 stops to Roma Termini central station.  This was a perfect air b n b experience, and we would love to stay there again.  Thanks Mario and Maura!!  "
31464,476159,2011-08-26,776532,Carlos,"Marios home turned out to be our home in Rome! Fantastic! Mario is such a nice guy, and his place is very neat and cozy. We had a wonderful time. Just regret the short time we had in Rome. Loved Rome, loved Mario's home. totally recommended."
31464,489977,2011-08-31,752114,Grace,"This was the perfect airbnb experience. Mario was very thoughtful and accessible while he was away for the weekend. He prepared a basket and fridge full of food/drinks for continental breakfast throughout our 5 night stay. We had everything we could ask for - a well-stocked kitchen, laundry facilities, a comfortable bed, a clean house, wifi/computer and quick access to the metro. It's very convenient to get to all the tourist attractions. There is a supermarket and a produce store just down the street and the pizzeria around the corner was probably the most authentic Italian food we had in Rome!"
31464,517280,2011-09-10,665646,Dilyana,"If you want to see the sword of dâArtagnan and the cap of Sherlock Holmes, and also the longest cactus in the world, go to Marioâs place! :)
Itâs very artistic, particular and youâll discover that the host has lots of different interests and abilities. And heâs the most caring and kind host ever! He provided us with maps, useful information and advice, and we were able to use his PC and internet.
The place is very calm and quiet, and the metro station is just 5 minutes walking from there.
Grazie, Mario! Siamo felici di conoscerti!

31464,526848,2011-09-13,344747,Carla,"Mario is a super host and he has the most delightful home. He really went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and to provide us with tips and suggestions for our time in Rome. It was really nice being able to use the kitchen and washing machine and the bottle of wine on the balcony was a kind gesture that we really appreciated. The room is spacious and clean with a comfortable bed. The air-con was an added bonus after a few hot days in the city. The location is great. A short 15-30min metro ride from the city and all the main attractions. For those that like art, it is lovely to look at Mario's sculptures and art works throughout his trendy home. 110% recommend you stay with Mario if you are visiting Rome. "
31464,535521,2011-09-16,647922,Amanda,"Our 3-day stay at Mario's home was a fantastic introduction to Italian hospitality. Not only is his home beautiful and comfortable, but Mario himself went out of his way to welcome us. He met us at the metro station (which is a quick walk down the street past convenient market shops of all the things you may need), helped us with luggage, and even provided city maps and a bottle of wine! 

When we mentioned we'd not eaten for far too long (having slept on the plane and missing meals) he offered to cook us our first meal in Italy! We took him up on it and were treated to a delicious homemade pasta + veggie dish.

Maybe it was just us being exhausted from all the trekking around the city, but the bed at Mario's has got to be one of the most comfortable ones ever. Also, since we stayed during the freakishly hot heat wave in September and were taking 2 showers a day just to feel not-so-grimey, having the option to wash the clothes we'd worn before leaving Rome was a great help - Mario has a wee washer in the kitchen, and plenty of clothesline on the balcony to air dry everything. 

We miss Rome already, and whenever we make it back, we'll definitely be looking to stay at Mario's again! "
31464,549485,2011-09-20,762973,Ruifan,"I spent 3 days in Mario's home, it's quite clean there. Mario is a nice person and quite helpful. The most important point is that his home is near metro station! "
31464,556661,2011-09-22,887195,Roland,"Mario immediately made us feel at home in his great apartment when we arrived. It is situated just a 2 minute walk from the Mount Tiburtini metro station, and is a fantastic quiet retreat from the bustle of downtown Rome. Our two night stay was too short!"
31464,573022,2011-09-27,527258,Patricia,"Planning a 'big' vacation can be somewhat undaunting, esp. when you are taking a 21 year old grand-daughter. Mario is one of my contacts who really went out of his way to help me. I told him he was amazing! Any info or maps He thought I might find useful, he sent to me. Arriving in Rome was a challenge as there was a lot of construction at the Termini, therefore we had to do some back-tracking once we found the elevator wasn't even working. The main thing is, we made it to Mario's and a friend of his met us at the Metro as Mario was out of town working. What a blessing she was. It was just a block to the apartment, but she took my luggage. Thank you Alba. (Using the metro to all parts of Rome and back, was very fast and easy to figure out.)
 Everything was nicely prepared for us, including a great assortment of things for our breakfast and a bottle of wine for a night cap!. We even had the liberty to cook in his kitchen and do our laundry. His home was very restful and clean. You can tell by comments of others and his own pictures, that his home is very artistically furnished and welcoming. We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Mario's Home. Sorry we didn't meet you personally Mario, but we did enjoy having the apartment to ourselves. All the best. Would love to visit Rome again and stay in your home."
31464,591951,2011-10-03,949176,James,"We loved Mario's place.
It is 6 stops out of the centre but it was great to get away from the tourists.
He was so welcoming and let us take over his apartment (his home was our home). 
Wonderfully decorated home and our favourite AirBNB stay so far."
31464,600052,2011-10-05,341335,Mark,"Marios apartment was a great location for our stay in Rome and Mario was a gracious, thoughtful and respectful host. If you want a stay in a lovely apartment in Rome then I would highly recommend a stay at Marios apartment. It is right near the metro station and so makes it really convenient to get around Rome. Perfect host highly recommended!"
31464,624949,2011-10-13,687117,Sagar,"Me and my friend had a lovely time in Mario's home. He was a great host, provided us with everything we needed, and we had the whole place to ourselves for the entire week. The apartment was beautiful, really nice to come back to after long days exploring Rome! Would recommend wholeheartedly."
31464,630110,2011-10-16,658805,Wai Yin,"mario & his friends very helpful!!! everything same as picture.    The most important point is that his home is near metro station, take bus 61 can direct go to city, everything is good, thank you very much!
 
 
   "
31464,641837,2011-10-18,521115,Rachelle,"One word: PERFECT! Seriously, from the beginning, Mario was excellent at communication and prior to arrival, offered to meet my husband and I at the metro station (he is just a 5-7 minute ride outside the city center which we loved so we were away from all the tourism) to walk us to his place. Mario stocked the fridge with delicious food (which we used to make an awesome Italian breakfast the next morning), gifted us with excellent wine upon arrival and put aside a large assortment of snacks for us to use during our stay. His apartment is BEAUTIFUL (he is a VERY talented artist), very clean and so much better than any hotel could ever offer. He was away for most of the weekend while we were there (visiting family), but was always accessible and lovely to talk to when around. If you can book this place during your stay in Rome, you won't forget it! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING MARIO!!!! You made our stay in Rome perfect!!! :o)"
31464,649126,2011-10-21,13494,Melissa,"Mario's home is beautiful! Our room was nicely decorated and very clean. We had a large private bathroom and full use of the apartment including the kitchen with complimentary breakfast and a nice bottle of wine, and a computer which was very helpful.  We felt very comfortable in Mario's apartment and would stay with him again in a heartbeat.
Thanks Mario!"
31464,665449,2011-10-26,672394,Irene,"Mario met us at the Metro with Alba and they helped us bring our heavy luggage to the apartment.  They were so helpful and pleasant and made us feel welcome.  We feel like we have know him for years.  The apartment is lovely and displays Mario's artwork and is stocked with wonderful books. The refrigerator was stocked with eggs, meat & cheese,fresh fruit, milk & juice. Also, there was cereal and many breakfast goodies.  Mario gifted us with a lovely bottle of wine.  The bed was the most comfortable we slept in during this 4 week vacation of ours.  We would stay there again if we ever get to Rome again and highly recommend staying in this lovely apartment.  Irene & Ron Corn"
31464,674904,2011-10-30,950278,Kuan Mun,"My very first airbnb experience and i was truly surprised by how pleasant it was! Mario was such an excellent host, very friendly and accomodating, and his apartment was wonderful! He was kind enough to meet us at the train station near his place upon arrival and gave us maps and pointers to ease navigation in such a big city! Thanks Mario for such a comfortable stay! :)"
31464,688465,2011-11-02,1116513,Glauco,"Mario ci ha ospitati nella sua casa e ci ha permesso di sentirci come fossimo invece a casa nostra. L'appartamento Ã¨ a mio avviso addirittura piÃ¹ caldo ed accogliente di come giÃ  risulta nelle foto. Mario Ã¨ una persona squisita e dai gusti raffinati, Ã¨ un'ottima compagnia se si vuol far due chiacchiere e invece Ã¨ molto discreto se si cerca un momento di privacy. La fermata della metropolitana dista poche centinaia di metri dall'abitazione e la zona permette a qualsiasi ora del giorno e della notte di trovare facilmente parcheggio per la macchina. La casa Ã¨ molto pulita, il bagno e la camera sono ad uso esclusivo degli ospiti e invece il soggiorno e la cucina sono in condivisione con il padrone di casa. C'Ã¨ un computer con internet, piÃ¹ wifi per chi dovesse avere il proprio, ad uso e consumo degli ospiti. Mario Ã¨ inoltre un ottimo cultore di cucina e buon bere, oltrechÃ¨ artista e persona sensibile, perciÃ² saprÃ  anche consigliare chi cerca nella cittÃ  eterna l'appagamento della gola oltre quello del senso del bello. Appena siamo arrivati ci ha fatto trovare una buona bottiglia di Chianti, come puoi non trovarti bene quando vieni coccolato a questo modo? CONSIGLIATISSIMO!"
31464,699899,2011-11-07,1320867,Ryan,"My wife and I had a perfect stay at Mario's place. The apartment is as described. Very clean, close to the Metro station, fast Wi-Fi connection and a fully stocked kitchen with everything provided for breakfast. The bottle of wine was a great touch as well. Mario was a great host. He was able to answer all our questions and had a map waiting for us. I highly recommend Marioâs apartment to anyone visiting Rome. Thanks Mario!"
31464,710554,2011-11-11,813583,Jel,"Host is kind and welcoming. Place has a character. Bed is very soft (note: for those who can't sleep on the soft surface). Neighbors television went on all night (, wasn't host's fault, but still kept us awake."
31464,750134,2011-11-28,1238879,Kristen,"What can I say, my stay at Mario's home was AMAZING!  The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photos and is filled with such character, artistry, and it is very clear that this is a well cared for space!  Although I didn't meet Mario personally(he was away on business travel), his friend, Nadia welcomed me warmly and even met me at the Monti Tiburtini metro stop, which is just a few steps from the apartment!  Mario left a stocked fridge, breakfast breads, and a wonderful bottle of wine waiting for me in the apt.  He also was so kind to leave cards for area restaurants, shopping, etc.  I can not imagine a better AirBnB experience.  As a solo female traveler, first time in Italy, I was SO very pleased with this experience.  The neighborhood was quiet, safe, and neighbors were very friendly. There is a supermarket and fruit/vegetable store just outside Mario's home, which is useful if you want to cook in the home. The apt. is only 10 mins to center of Rome and was extremely convenient to any place i wanted to travel(including very easy to get to and from airport!)If I am ever in Rome again, I will definitely choose Mario's place to stay again! I am also recommending him to all my friends who plan to visit Rome soon! Lovely, lovely experience!"
31464,778982,2011-12-12,452307,Carlo E Diana,"Mario gave us not only the bedroom, but the availability of almost the whole apartment, including a private bathroom and the kitchen. The place is comfortable, very clean and surrounded by the art of Mario.
It's very close to the metro and to many pizzerie and food markets.
Mario was very kind and generous: he gave us a bottle of wine, a good amount of food for the breakfast or little lunch and even a gift for our little girl.
It has been a pleasure to stay at his home! "
31464,790712,2011-12-18,889504,Joshua,"Marios' home is as good as you can find- plenty of room, including a private bathroom.  Beautifully decorated as well.  The location is phenomenal; great neighborhood and a five minute walk to the metro stop.  Mario was very kind and helpful with advice and directions.  Highly recommend staying here when in Rome.  "
31464,809846,2011-12-28,1230678,Yelena,"It was perfect! Mario was there when it was needed, not there when it wasn't. His flat is beautiful, Mario is generous and he trusts people with his stuff. I cannot imagine a better stay! Besides, it was a real BNB, with full breakfast, bread, jams, fruits, milk, cheese, eggs, ham. WE particularly appreciated it because we did not know that EVERYTHING would be closed on the 24, 25 and 26 of December! So we survived thanks to Mario's extra bread and butter. "
31464,818032,2011-12-31,1446190,Stefania,"The apartment is great, really stylish and very close to the metro station. It's near to the city centre but at the same time it's in a quiet area. Mario is a really kind person and it was a real pleasure to talk with him. Absolutely recommended!! :)"
31464,841217,2012-01-06,1276299,Dominik,"Mario is an awesome host. It was the best holidays we ever had. The flat is soooo beautiful, with a big and confortable living room, a small but fine kitchen, a big bedroom and our own bathroom. Everthing was very clean and tidy. The breakfast was delicious, the best was the freshly pressed orangejuice every morning to start your day right. Roma is a wonderful place to travel. We get lots of information from Mario for Sights and he gave us a city map, so everything was easy to find. The next station is very near and within five minutes  you arrived at Roma Termini. THANKS TO MARIO for these wonderful 5 days in Roma. We advise you to live at Marios home if you want to visit Roma. "
31464,848939,2012-01-08,269427,Louise,"Mario was such a wonderful host! My boyfriend and I stayed with Mario for approximately 3 days and we enjoyed every moment of it. He even welcomed us with a great bottle of Chianti! 

His apartment is conveniently located off the B-Line which made it so easy for us to get around. 

The room was clean and beautifully arranged. It definitely felt like home for us. He provided towels and welcomed us to anything in his kitchen (we ate out the whole time there...come on....we're in Italy...PIZZAS EVERYWHERE!). The bathroom was no different than the room - super clean and well stocked with anything we needed. 

We would love to stay with Mario again if he'll let us. :)"
31464,945157,2012-02-24,1349673,Anthony,"Mario was a great host.  His home is clean, beautiful and artfully decorated.  He was very informative with brochures and maps of the area.  Breakfast selection was delicious.  Was very helpful that he spoke English so well.  We had everything that we needed for a wonderful stay in Rome.  His location was close to the subway and to nice places to eat and shop for groceries."
31464,962054,2012-03-01,1667131,Sarah,"Mario's place was really nice and offered everything we needed. Everything was really clean and we were able to use the kitchen to save a few $$. Mario was not there when we arrived but one of his best friends - such a nice person - explained everything.
Although we didn't get to see Mario very often, he was really nice and we felt totally at home in the apartment. He even left a bottle of wine for us which was a nice gesture.
The only thing we could have needed was a little advice concernin good restaurants because we weren't very lucky with finding good ones... But there has never been time to ask during our quick conversations...
But all in all - perfect location (2 minutes from metro stop) and really nice apartment (with private bathroom). "
31464,972585,2012-03-05,1458313,Marge,Our stay at Mario's place was absolutely wonderful! His house is amazing: a story in every corner you look at! He has cared about all details in order to make us happier and enjoy Rome. We really felt at home! Hope to see you again Mario!!!
31464,990003,2012-03-12,1391267,June,"Mario has been a very good host. We were supposed to stay at his apartment for 4nights. But due to emergency back home, we had to cut short our trip and rush back to Singapore. Mario was very helpful in helping us book last min air tickets and even asked his English speaking friend to rush over to communicate with us better. His apartment is true to the photos as seen and he made sure we had clean towels and even offered to cook dinner for us! He recommended a few good restaurants but we were unable to visit them due to our time constraint. A wonderful host!!!!!!!!! "
31464,1049319,2012-03-27,1553487,Olyvia,"My husband and I stayed in Mario's flat for four days while visiting Rome and we could not have asked for a more gracious host or comfortable accommodations while we were there.  Mario gave us full use of the entire flat in addition to our private bedroom and bathroom, and even provided us with a huge array of breakfast foods to eat while we were there.  It was a huge relief to not have to search for breakfast every morning and we took full advantage of his many treats!  We also had to deal with getting to the airport in the middle of the night for our return flight, and Mario went out of his way to arrange a taxi for us and make sure that we understood what we had to do that night when it arrived.  Although we shared the flat with him the whole time he was very inconspicuous and we felt like we had plenty of space.  The flat is beautifully decorated and it was fascinating to observe all the various artwork and furniture that he has collected over the years.  The only two drawbacks we experienced while staying there were very loud neighbors and the hassle of getting to and from central Rome.  The neighbors talked and played the TV at incredibly loud volumes at all hours, including as early as 7:00 AM and as late as 11:00 PM, making it very hard to sleep.  In addition the lack of infrastructure in the Roman metro system made getting around very exhausting after a long day - so this should be considered if you are not somebody who is willing to commute while traveling!  However, neither of these things were under Mario's control and again, we can't say enough good things about him and how enjoyable our stay was with him!  We would definitely stay with Mario again if we returned to Rome.  Grazie Mario!"
31464,1071166,2012-04-02,1639869,Connie,"This was our first time to try bnb and we just loved it. Mario, thank you so much for your kindness and help. You are the best host and you are the nicest person we ever met. Your place is conveniently located, close to metro, most important, it is very spacious, clean and safe. My husband and I enjoyed our stay with you at all time. Mario, we are the best cook and chef, thank you for teaching how to cook the real Italian pasta. 
Also we had a wonderful dinner with Mario and Nadia, we will never forget. Thank you, Mario.  "
31464,1108509,2012-04-11,1617165,Jude,"Mario was absolutely wonderful. He was very helpful and sent out all the information and maps long before our trip and was very accommodating. He also prepared a lovely breakfast hamper for us to have and arranged for us to have gym passes at the local gym (if you're into that sort of thing).  He let us make use of the entire apartment (we had our own private bathroom even) and made it his priority to give us our privacy - it was almost as if we had our own apartment in Rome for a week! He was always there when we needed him but was also very much out of our way. Thanks to Mario we had a lovely stay in Rome. 

Although the apartment is not in central Rome, it only takes 15 minutes or so by train and is just outside the train station with several lovely shops and a few very local cafe's, so we could explore a different side of Rome. The people at the shop were very helpful and loved our funny accents, and we had fresh cheese and prosciutto every day for lunch.

Overall, we really rated our visit and would definitely recommend Mario to all of our friends. "
31464,1150417,2012-04-19,263068,Li Tin,"Mario was the perfect host - kind, friendly and helpful. He left almost the whole apartment for our usage and the place was tastefully decorated and  clean and cosy. We appreciated the large selection of breakfast food for our consumption every morning as well!

His apartment is located just 5 minutes away from Monti Tiburtini station on the convenient Blue Line (direct to Colosseum), just 6 stops away from the central Termini station.

Apart from rather loud neighbours (we were so tired and fell asleep on the comfy bed very easily), Mario's apartment really made us feel at home. Thanks Mario for being so lovely!"
31464,1167440,2012-04-23,1809111,Ben,"Nice place, Mario was a great host and accommodated us very well. Definitely recommend"
31464,1187520,2012-04-27,1512919,Joon Hol,"What a wonderful home to stay! Me and my wife love to stay at Mario's home. Very clean home, bedroom and private toilet. Mario's is very friendly and one of the coolest man I ever met. His home is like a little museum. Location wise, very convenient and near to Metro station (about 200m), and the metro station has lift too, so you don't have to carry your baggage up over the Stair. Many thanks to Mario."
31464,1207502,2012-05-01,312013,Annabel,"Thanks Mario, for the fantastic stay. The pics are accurate. The comments are accurate. "
31464,1229012,2012-05-05,1764360,Alma,"We stayed at Mario's Home from 30 April till 4 May, and everything was perfect. The room is very nice and cozy. The kitchen is really well equipped, so you can have nice breakfast and dinner. There is a supermarket on the way from metro station to the home. The metro station is 5 min walk, and 10 min ride to Termini. Mario is a very nice person, and he did his best to make our stay very good!!! Thanks Mario and Nadya, and hopefully we'll stay again at your place when we're in Rome!"

31464,1297664,2012-05-18,1687240,Samantha,"We loved our stay with Mario! It was like having our own apartment in Rome but also having the help of a local! Mario was so nice, greeted us with a bottle of wine and provided us with breakfast each morning. His house is very close to the metro which is nice and in a quiet neighborhood so you can escape from the hustle and bustle of central Rome. Thank you for everything Mario!"
31464,1349218,2012-05-26,1615025,Romy,"Mario was a wonderful host. We enjoyed our stay in his beautiful apartment. He was very helpful with info about the Metro and how to navigate  from his place to all the significant sides in Rome. We had a wonderful time and can only recommend Mario's Home. 
Thank you, Mario, for being a perfect host. and making our stay in Rome very enjoyable."
31464,1417553,2012-06-05,1620337,Julie,"Staying in Marios apartment was perfect... it was a sigh of relief when coming ""home"" from busy/loud central Rome, into his quiet and charming neighbourhood, where you have everything within a 5 minute walk. It's very easy to use the metro system and navigate through the streets around his apartment, and safe as well. Mario offered us a bottle of wine upon arrival, and a huge breakfast every morning! (Eggs, coffee, milk for cappuccino, fruit, bread(s), even prosciutto!) He gives you your own set of keys, and essentially the entire apartment. We only saw Mario once during our stay- which was sad because I wanted to thank him in person for such a lovely stay!!
So, thank you Mario for hosting on AirbNb, your apartment is beautiful and your art is very unique- great conversation arose from just looking at all your sculptures, paintings, etc. We had a lot of lovely moments just relaxing on the back deck watching the sunset, drinking wine, eating pizza, talking about Italy and it's beautiful culture- I do not think we would have seen the true ""roman culture"" if we would have stayed in the city. In fact, I'm sure of it. Your place is a real gem. Grazie mille!! Julie & Jon. "
31464,1454624,2012-06-11,1997523,Priscilla,"Staying in Mario's is an experience on its own as Mario has decorated the aprtment so well and he is a man of many many talents. The place is lovely with a very experienced host. Mario gave us so much privacy, we almost had the whole place to ourselves, but he was always available when we needed him. The apartment is just a 5min walk to the metro and has many shops around it. I highly recommend staying with Mario. It is very good value."
31464,1472372,2012-06-13,1853406,Pia,"We stayed at Mario's home for 2 nights - it was LOVELY!

We basically had the whole flat to ourselves; Mario was there some of the time but truly was as quiet as a mouse - we barely saw or heard him. It's a lovely place to chill, but it's also really near the Metro (3-4 mins walk) so it's super-quick to get into the centre of Rome.

The flat was spotless, full of weird and wonderful beautiful things, and nice and quiet as it's away from any main road. Great place to stay :-)"
31464,1533477,2012-06-22,1671611,Sandy,"This was my husband and my first time in Rome. It was a magical experience! The house was amazing looking and Mario opened his entire house to us. It was clean and had all the comforts of home.Mario was a wonderful host and we also enjoyed Nadia. She is a doll!! Mario made us a chef's dinner (he has written an art/cookbook called Chef's Out"") that was so yummy! What a treat! We also attended a theater with Mario and Nadia. It was a great night out and a wonderful stay. Something we will not forget. Our room was private. The flat included a couch, sitting area,dining area, as well as the queen bed and private bathroom and access to a computer which really came in handy. We were alos able to do wash there in his home.Mario met us at the metro which is a block from his place.Mario was there to greet and meet us and go over anything we might need. He also suggested some great places to eat that were not flooded with tourists. The breakfast goodies and coffee in the morning was a real treat and a great way to start each day. My only regret is that we could not stay longer..... this time. We hope to be back and would definitely recommend his place.
Thank you for making great memories for us!"
31464,1562338,2012-06-25,715121,Derya,"me and my niece stayed Mario's flat and we called him Super Mario ;))
Because his flat so beautiful and clean that you will feel yourself like at home.Mario is a very kind person who helps everything and has a good heart and his positive energy feels at home.
I highly recommended to stay Mario's flat.When we arrived first day he took us from the metro station and give us lots of information even we together have gone for dinner and he didn't let us to pay the bill...
I m so happy to stay his home.For Rome it is the best place to stay..."
31464,1758725,2012-07-21,1525515,Regina,"As a woman travelling alone, choosing a safe place to stay is hugely important. I stayed at Mario's home for 25 days and I wouldn't recommend staying anywhere else! Mario has created a comfortable, convenient, affordable, and safe place to stay while visting Rome. Mario also went out of his way to help me plan and make me feel at home. I cannot say enough about how gracious of a host Mario is.  I will certainly be back!"
31464,1889175,2012-08-05,1109430,Erick,"Mario is the best host ever! It's like going back home, you feel his confidence, helpness, kindness every second of your stay.

And what about the place? PERFECT, it's very well located, safe, extremely clean, the room is big, bed is awesome, private bathroom what else do you need? 

Absolutely 150% recommended, if i come back to Rome i will stay with him again. Me and my friend love his flat."
31464,1988031,2012-08-14,3000065,Tania,"We stayed at Mario's for 3 nights in August. We had a wonderful stay - it was very clean and comfortable. Mario was a kind and helpful host, though we hardly saw him! The location is quite and very convient to the Metro. We would recommend it."
31464,2054640,2012-08-21,2895873,Dave & Kristin,"It's difficult to say anything above and beyond what the other reviews have already mentioned.  Every positive review of Mario and his place are completely accurate.  He gives great directions to his apartment, the Metro is so close and convenient, and the restaurants in the neighborhood are fantastic; La Margarita and Gelateria Artigianale Siciliana are especially great!  Mario himself is a wonderful host, available if you need him but also so quiet you might not even know he's home.  Essentially, staying at Mario's place is like having your own apartment in Rome...and it's fantastic!"
31464,2205263,2012-09-05,2623636,Rozairy,Mario is very friendly and his place is so conveniently located near the Metro. Extremely safe neighborhood surrounded with eateries and convenient stores. Place is nice and clean and i'm very fortunate to have the whole house to myself as he is travelling. Highly recommended for travelers who wanted to explore Rome and he will advice all the interesting place to go and visit. Cheers..!!! 
31464,2353850,2012-09-20,3344006,Tamar,"Our experience with Mario was most favorable. It should be noted that we stayed for a mere two days and used the bulk of that time experiencing the beauty of Rome (of which there was a lot to experience by the way :D). Mario was very accommodating and respectful to our needs. When we got out of the train station- there he was waiting for us and wasted no time helping with our bags. He made us feel right at home and was generous with his sightseeing suggestions. The commute to the city was about ten minutes and his place is about block away from the station. His apartment is quite charming. The bathroom is beautiful and very clean. The bedroom is exquisitely presented and quiet. Over all his place has a calming yet passionate flow about it. His appreciation for collectors items and antiques are apparent and beguiling. It gave an added ambience to our Roman holiday, waking up in the morning as well as coming home at the end of the day. We highly recommend Mario for your Roman vacation. We only wish that we had blocked out some more downtime for ourselves just to enjoy his apartment! Bellissimo, Mario! Bellissimo!"
31464,2480621,2012-10-02,1559243,Eduardo,"Si bien Mario no estaba por cuestiones laborales, se encargo que Nadia, una amiga suya, se encargara de entregarnos las llaves y mostrarnos las comodidades. El apartamento es increible. Libros, cuadros, esculturas. Es como estar en una mezcla de museo, galerÃ­a de arte y bar temÃ¡tico. Muy buena experiencia. Estacionamos el auto en una playa cercana y nos movilizamos con metro. Vale la pena."
31464,3041499,2012-12-08,4012063,Oleksandr,"Mario is the best host we have ever met. His apartment is like an art gallery. Mario helped us a lot to understand Italian culture. He shared his apartment with us, we became friends. I'd like to recommend Mario for each traveler who decided to travel to Rome."
31464,3087376,2012-12-14,4233778,Hayley,Mario is a very nice and helpful host. We had a very comfortable time staying in this delicate and clean house. The breakfast was also rich and yummy. I'll definitely recommend my friends to choose Mario's home when they visit Rome.
31464,3170951,2012-12-28,4033323,Meryl,"Mario was a lovely host. He greeted us when we arrived and showed us around the apartment, giving us maps of Rome and other useful guidebooks to look through. The space was clean and beautifully decorated and we felt like we had the place to ourselves. Mario was quiet but always helpful when we needed him. We cooked our own meals a lot and the kitchen was fully stocked which was greatly appreciated. Would definitely stay with Mario again the next time we're in Rome! Thank you for a wonderful week!

All the best,
Meryl and Ariel "
31464,3585440,2013-02-19,4723726,Ramudhaykumar,"Literally, i felt it was like a home i own.  He left the whole apartment in our hands (except the 1 bedroom he occupies). Full facilities provided, spacious bedroom, spacious bathroom. Breakfast was simple but ample, tasty cookies, and the whole kitchen is yours too.

Apartment is located on the 8th floor in one of the buildings in a huge compound. A bit difficult to find initially, but when i showed the security guard Mario's pic, he straightaway pointed me to the building entrance .  2 mins walk to the metro, very easy to reach the touristic spots with the metro. The apartment is a bit off the main area, but a great way to unwind your day after being overwhelmed with mighty Rome. A great value for money, and Fabio was a very generous and kind host. Would definitely return."
31464,3815321,2013-03-18,4778997,Yuan,"The house is fantastic and full of artistic details!!! To stay here, it's convenient to take the subway. There are places around to get food and daily items. It's really a good choice when you travel in Rome. I will definitely recommend it to my friends!!!"
31464,3938623,2013-03-29,5174962,Enrika,"Staying at Mario's house was an absolutely wonderful experience-he's a great host, interesting personality and he was always willing to help us if we needed something. The location of Mario's house is really convenient as it is only about 100 meters from the metro station and only ten minutes to the center by the subway. There are some very nice pizzerias and groceries around Mario's house, so we found some really nice places for reasonable prices to have our dinner at. We would definitely recommend staying at Mario's and if we come to Rome again we would always choose his flat to stay at. Thank you, Mario:)

31464,3974725,2013-04-01,4921239,Julie,"L'appart de Mario est trÃ¨s bien situÃ©, 2min a pied du mÃ©tro. La chambre est au calme car l'immeuble ne donne pas sur la rue. Le lit est grand, la salle de bain agrÃ©able et la cuisine fonctionnelle et Mario est super sympa. Je reviendrai !"
31464,4021456,2013-04-03,3467857,Yolandi,"We had a very nice stay at Mario's place. The room was very clean and spacious with entire cupboard made available for our clothes. The room is not in the centre of Rome, but close to the train station in a quiet suburb, this train stop was just a few minutes from Termini station. Mario made a very nice breakfast available to us which we enjoyed very much. He is very professional and helpful, but at the same time you won't even know that he is in the apartment. He gave us a lot of privacy. We also loved the very arty apartment in the flat. We can definitely recommend Mario and his apartment."
31464,4052401,2013-04-06,5198880,Marc,"Mario vive en una zona muy tranquila y poco turistica de Roma y nos atendio con todo lo necesario, el piso es un lugar bonito y limpio con toda una serie de comodidades y mucho arte , Mario nos guio en todo lo que necesitavamos para conocer la ciudad y la cultura del pais, y nos sentimos muy acogidos y seguros en su casa, solo estuvimos dos dias pero tubimos ganas de quedarnos muchos dias mas disfrutando la hospitalidad del lugar."
31464,4148698,2013-04-14,5235981,Alexandre,"I went to an Eurotrip with a friend and we stayed in four apartments through AirBnB (Paris, Florence, Rome and London) and by far Mario's place was the best one. 
Mario is the most polite person and very kind and helpful as well.
Unfortunately he had a trip scheduled on the same days that we stayed at his place, so we never had the chance to get to know each other better, but I'd definately stay in his place again when I'm in Rome."

Dear Mario,
my son and I, we had a wonderful time in Rome and at your flat. We had everything we needed. It was a very comfortable staying. Easy to take the metro to the centre (10 min). Your neighbors were also very friendly to us. I can completley recommend your place. Thanks for your hospitability.

31464,4530297,2013-05-11,2572499,... Gene & Shawn,"Loved Mario's home - a true home away from home!!! The location was terrific - within 500 feet of the subway - very easy to access all the wonderful sites, restaurants and neighbourhoods of Rome. His apartment is terrifically cozy - wonderful to relax in at the end of a busy day of sightseeing and restauranting. Very comfortable bed and great kitchen with all the amenities. Did not have the opportunity to meet Mario - which would have been a delight - but felt like we got to know him a bit through all his ecclectic and interesting art and pursuits that are reflected throughout his apartment. Communication was great - good arrangements made to transfer key upon arrival - thoughtful host touches throughout the apartment. Overall a great accomodation experience - would definetly love to stay again on a future visit to Rome - Highly Recommended!!!"
31464,4609846,2013-05-15,313937,Ginger,We really enjoyed our stay at Mario's home. It's like an art gallery and very clean. Mario was not at home during our visit and trusted us  his entire apartment. We would definitely stay with him again when visiting Rome. Thank you Mario!
31464,4675765,2013-05-20,5326209,Tony,"Mario is a great host, has great sense of humor and is allways ready to lend a hand. He would go to great extents to try to please us and would not stop until we had all th einformation we may have asked about. His place is really nice and very well located (3 minuts walk from the metro station). It is easy to find and away from the crouds. We simply loved being amid the locals and away from all the turists. The great restaurant arround the corner is also fabulous for a great meal at a very decent price.Wonderfull staff as well. 
All in all we had a great stay would stay in his place again and really recomend it to any Airbnb users, great value for the money and with a wonderfull host like Mario it is a win win situation, "
31464,4757837,2013-05-24,5685324,Michael And Silenia,"Mario's home is situated in a neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas yet, it is just a few meters away from the metro that will take you there.  He gives you full reign of the house so you feel like the host and he is the guest.  His place is clean and cozy with interesting books, furniture, and Mario's artwork. 
Mario is a kind and generous host, an artist, and gentleman.  I would highly recommend his place to anyone who was looking for a place to stay in Rome."
31464,4803478,2013-05-27,5409067,Alexa,"Mario was a great host and his apartment was gorgeous and spotless! He was extremely kind to us and very willing to help, even when we were slightly winging our day :) We were only sorry we didn't get to see more of him as his apartment was a perfect mirror of himself and showed us how interesting of a person he is! We loved our time in Rome and would definitely stay at Mario's again.  If you want a beautiful place with a great location and a warm and welcoming host, this is where you need to be!"
31464,4898357,2013-06-01,3683971,Sandy,"Mario's place, although not in the tourist part of Rome, is very accessible. It's literally steps away from a subway station. There is a grocery store and a great pizza place near by. 
His place is overall very well decorated and very artsy.
We simply loved it!
"
31464,4962272,2013-06-04,5500203,Per,"I thought my son and I would get a room. But we got an appartement with our own room, bathroom, livingroom and kitchen. And free wifi. A bottle of wine. That I forgot to take with me home. Sorry. With a small pizzaplace 300 m away. Close to Termini station, only 4-5 metrostop. And Mario as a taxidriver from his home to Termini station, which indeed was an experience for a Scandinavian driver. But we survived! "
31464,5289068,2013-06-23,2951146,Tim,We hebben het heerlijk gehad in Rome en Mario's appartementje was perfect. Vlak bij de metro (je zit dus zo in het centrum) en wat winkeltjes voor dagelijkse boodschappen. Mario is Bijzonder vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Aanrader!
31464,5411205,2013-06-29,5580627,Dan,We stayed with Mario for 6 nights for our first trip to Rome and we couldn't have been in a more comfortable home. Mario was very welcoming and even helped us plan our first day. The location was fantastic and very easy to get to. I would definitely stay at Mario's house again without a second thought!
31464,5707530,2013-07-13,5533986,Cassandra,"Mario was great, apartment was great and had a nice balcony to enjoy. Location was good for getting into the city."
31464,5841537,2013-07-19,4678125,Samantha,"My husband and I stayed with Mario and his soon-to-be-wife, Derya, for 5 days, They were both lovely hosts--very accomdating and super friendly. They both helped us navigate Rome and gave us suggestions on where to go and what to eat. When the AC went out in our bedroom, Mario was quick to tell the maintenace man and even bought us a bottle of wine as an apology!  He also took the time to show us his art studio and treated us to dinner. We had a lovely experience and I definitely reccommend staying in his apartment!!"
31464,5937608,2013-07-23,5405057,Billy,"We were really fortunate to have had Mario and Derya as our hosts, a lovely couple whose first words to us were to regard their house as our own. We felt very welcomed right away, they even gave us an excellent bottle of red wine! The house itself was wonderful and homey. Mario is a great artist and we were impressed with the diverse array of art he put on display in the house! Also, it is extremely clean and well taken care of. The house, combined with Mario's and Derya's great kindness and hospitality, makes the place a highly recommended one for anyone visiting Rome! We can't wait to be go back."
31464,6064855,2013-07-29,4939570,Petra,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was a very positive one. Mario is a very kind host and the apartment is really beautiful, and very clean. I can only agree on the many positive reviews here. Close to metro, so very quick access to the centre. Airco in the room which is really great if you plan on seeing rome in the middle of summer :o) There's a nice balcony to enjoy breakfast and you hardly know if Mario is there, as he leave you a lot of privacy. Highly recommended."
31464,6298001,2013-08-07,4858904,Shawn,"Mario and his fiance were great hosts who were very responsive to any questions we had. The room was quite spacious and most importantly had air conditioning which was crucial in the August heat. 
The apartment is approx a 15 min metro (train) ride from the main Termini and approx 20-25 mins door to door. Mario's apartment is approx 200m from the metro station. Pls make sure to ask Mario for his building number/letter as there are quite a few buildings in the same complex. "
31464,6964053,2013-09-01,5944111,Mikey,"Mario is a talented artist and sculptor as well as a kind and considerate host.  His art and eclectic collections create an atmosphere of comfortable interest in his home.  Upon our arrival he showed us our room, the bath, and explained the details of cooking in the kitchen.  From that moment forward we felt completely at home.  We had arrived from the USA a day late and without our luggage due to problems with our airplane.  Mario let us follow our own schedule, eating and sleeping at odd hours until we were comfortable with the time change.  His advice regarding restaurants in the neighborhood was spot on.  Another bonus of Marioâs location is that it is very near the metro.  We were able to efficiently travel in the City of Rome and take advantage of tours learning about the history, art, and magic of this wonderful place.  Oh, and Mario was kind enough to arrange to have our luggage delivered when it finally arrived as well.  We canât wait to go back to Rome and stay with him again!"
31464,7082556,2013-09-05,8235032,Mario,"My stay in Rome was really good. Mario was a great host and he met me and my girlfriend at the station near his house as soon as we arrived in Rome. The apartment is very beautiful and cozy, the was everything you need, kitchen, bathroom, living room and a very nice room with ac.
We visit for only couple of nights and Mario gave us enough info to move around the city. The location was very good, the place is full of art (mario is a talent artist) and we got a bottle of wine as courtesy.
I recommend !

31464,7093552,2013-09-06,6654831,Nirmala,We enjoyed  staying at Mario's home. It is a beautiful house with lot  of artworks. We felt very free staying their . The location is also quiet convenient to travel to the sightseeing places. He is a nice host.
31464,7143645,2013-09-08,8143639,Oleg,"This was our first time in Italy and Rome in particular. We were driving and need to park, so Mario met us outside and helped us find parking spot (which was very close to the building). Mario is a great host, kind and welcoming person. Met us with the present that we were enjoying with the dinner on his balcony overlooking the city :)
As we figured, Mario is a recognized artist and his apartment is a real museum or arts gallery - so many pieces of art everywhere! At the same time, everything is clean and organized. Building is in quiet neighborhood but just two minutes from the metro station - really convenient! Overall, great experience! Highly recommend!"
31464,7311766,2013-09-15,8410458,Tony,"We used airbnb for the first time.
Mario is a pleasant host an the appartement is very nice.
The City Center can be reaches in 25 Minutes by Metro. 
The Metro Stop is 5 Mimnutes walk near the appartement.
Apart from the supermarket, there are severel of small shops at bargain shopping for fruits an vegetables. The Kitchen is equipped with gas stove an very well. We did the cook love. All together we have found good.

He could not have been any more accommodating. He was the perfect host! 
This was our first Airbnb stay and I think it will be very hard to ever match in the future. We highly recommend Mario and his apartment for a stay in Rome.

31464,8447382,2013-10-31,9101692,Cavallo,"Ho molto apprezzato l'ospitalitÃ , la disponibilitÃ  e la gentilezza di Mario. Ci ha dato dei buoni consigli per il nostro soggiorno a Roma. L'appartamento Ã¨ molto accogliente. La posizione Ã¨ perfetta se si vuole rimanere un pÃ² piÃ¹ fuori dal centro della Roma turistica, la fermata della metropolitana B (Monti Tiburtini) Ã¨ a pochi passi dalla casa di Mario (5 min) e in 15-20 minuti di metro si raggiunge il centro. Lo terrÃ² sicuramente presente per i prossimi viaggi a Roma."
31464,8868630,2013-11-23,5026879,Wolfgang,"In Mario's Appartment habe ich mich sehr wohlgefÃ¼hlt.. Wie beschrieben war alles zutreffend: ein wunderbares Bett, gemÃ¼tliches und anregendes Wohnzimmer, funktionierende, gut ausgestattete KÃ¼che, eigenes  sauberes Bad. Mario war sehr nett und hatte mir als besonderes Plus meine Sprachkenntnisse in italienisch erweitert.

Sono molto contento. Volontieri voglio ritornare. Carol Mario, grazie per tutto.

Wolfgang"
31464,9166436,2013-12-10,2778862,Karen,"We stayed at Mario's apartment for 2 weeks late Nov / early Dec. Mario is a great host, he is very polite and will go out of his way to make you feel confortable. He takes great pride in his home, and it shows, there is a lot of great art and decor in his apartment, it feels like being in a museum. Everything is clean and spotless. The apartment can get a bit cold during the winter, but the bedsheets & comforter kept us warm & toasty throughout the nights, plus there is a heater. We only saw Mario 3x during our entire stay, and sometimes it felt like we were the only ones in the whole apartment (he's a hard worker!). The bathroom is very clean and big, and the kitchen is fully stocked. He provided us with bread, eggs, milk, jam, pastries, and biscuits, and even gave us a bottle of wine and mozarella as our welcome snack! Wi-fi is also good.

The apartment itself is in a great location, it's outside of the tourist bubble of Central Rome, but literally a 5 minute walk away from the Metro station. (It takes about 20-30 mins to get to the city center, depending on frequency of trains.) There is a supermarket down the block, as well as 3 grocers if you want to cook for yourself, and 4 pizza shops within a 2 minute radius. A nice park is nearby too!

The one downside (and it's not Mario's fault at all) is that the neighbors on the other side of the bedroom wall are very loud. The wall seemed quite thin, and you could hear the neighbors talking (""yelling"") quite often. They also would leave the TV on all night with the volume up. The neighbor is also a very loud snorer, it felt as if he were sleeping right next to us! Bring earplugs just in case!

Overall, I would highly recommend Mario's place, it was a comfortable home for two weeks, and we would definitely return again!

31464,9219637,2013-12-14,10450061,Minhee,"Wonderful memory in Mario's home

This was my first in Airbnb and I was a little bit of worried, cause I thought be it would be okay if I stay at a stranger's accomodation like everyone.
And thanks to the feedback and comment of yours, I could be his home warm and comfortable.
One of the reasons I decided to go to Mario's room was that the place itself was very artistic. So unique it was. I loved the bed as well.
It's clean enough,actually too clean! haha!!
He offered good qualified coffee wine and snacks etc.
Thanks a lot! I really enjoyed  there with my mom!!
Hope to see him again, I introduced his home to my friends already!
Happy new year!!"

The room was beautifully decorated, very clean, and quite spacious. The wall adjoining to the neighbor was a bit thin, but we still had a very pleasant stay. We were also provided a great selection of breakfast materials, which was quite nice and very helpful.

The location was fabulous- a quiet residential area located no more than 3 minutes from the Monti Tiburtini metro stop, which takes you directly to all the classic tourist sites as well as Termini, the main train station in the area.

Thanks, Mario!"
31464,9369674,2013-12-24,5169107,Lun,"It is an awesome place decorated with Mario's artwork. The bedroom is huge with a soft queen-size bed. However we could hear the TV and conversation next doors at night. Earplugs would be helpful. The apartment is conveniently located near the metro station. It takes about 10 min to Rome city by metro train. We enjoyed our meals at the little pizza shop nearby. Mario is a very considerate host, providing the sightseeing and other useful info."

Mario's apartment is in a great location, just 2 min to the Metro, grocery, butcher etc. But his flat is in a quite and safe residential complex. He came to receive us in the Metro station and greeted us with a bottle of wine and snacks in his apartment. Moreover, there was enough supplies for breakfast and dinner!!! - which we were not able to finish eating...

The day after Christmas Mario brought for us cookies made by his mother, those were fabulous!!! Thank you Mario. Those who do not know - Mario is an artist, and every inch of his apartment feels like a piece of art :-)

Many thanks to Mario for taking care of us and his great hospitality, he is an wonderful host."
31464,9517628,2014-01-01,8147693,Tania,We spent 2 lovely days at Mario's house.  They were the most comfortable nights sleep I have ever had!  Mario and Darya gave us privacy and helpful advice during our short stay in Rome. Would thoroughly recommend
31464,9680102,2014-01-05,10019951,Cc,"We had a great time staying at Mario's place.  Mario was very friendly and welcomed us with a nice bottle of Chianti on New Year's Day! His apartment is exactly like what's shown in the picture, artistic, almost like a museum.   Our bedroom is spacious and the bed is quite comfortable.   Mario was very considerate and discreet.  He retreated into his own room when we were in the apartment to let us use the living room all by ourselves.  Every morning we had an elaborate breakfast and Mario gave us access to his entire kitchen.  

His apartment is only 2 min walk to the metro station.  There are quite a few grocery stores and a nice super market with Italian cured meat and cheese nearby.  

We highly recommend Mario's place. Thank you Mario! "
31464,9835578,2014-01-13,8838202,Andrea,"Mario's apartment was clean, safe and easy to get to from the metro. It was everything that I needed. A very comfortable bed. "

31464,10205199,2014-02-06,6821092,Elena,"Abbiamo soggiornato 4 gg a Roma in Mario's home. Ci siamo trovati bene per la vicinanza alla stazione metro, per la casa confortevole e tranquilla, per la cordialitÃ  di Mario.
Elena e Franco"
31464,10300218,2014-02-11,26027,Stephanie,"For the three days before I stayed at Mario's, I had business meetings and I was staying at a 5-star hotel near the Pantheon, paid for by the host of the business meetings. It was a centrally located, well-appointed hotel, but I had a much better experience staying at Mario's. He has created a home that is truly a work of art, and you can see the thought, care, and amazing aesthetic sense that has gone into each room. I felt relaxed just being in the space. Beyond that, Mario is an incredibly nice person. He even shared his mother's pasta with me for dinner one night! I hope I can return to Rome someday and stay at Mario's home again."
31464,10408710,2014-02-17,3844781,Aisha,"By far the best host ever! Me and my girlfriend stayed over at Mr.Mario's apartment between 13 and 16 feb!  First of, He had a bottle of vine for us to welcome with! Than from the transportation to His apartment, to the neighborhood, hence everything was just above satisfactory! His apartment is a fine work of art and is very easily reachable from Rome airport! He gave us perfect directions to get to his apartment and finding his apartment with the provided directions was a piece of cake! The whole apartment was for us to stay while he was away for work! But he would regularly msg me and inquire on my well being and if I needed anything! I definitely recomend this apartment! It is a 'not to be missed stayintlg at' apartment :)"
31464,10482931,2014-02-21,11482779,Geoff,"Thankyou Mario for an enjoyable stay in your home. We had the flat to ourselves for the first 2 days as Mario was away. We met Mario on the last full day we were there. We had a very enjoyable experience there, clean, modern and very comfortable. Mario's flat was extremely interesting, he is clearly a clever and creative person. We recommend this property."
31464,10744174,2014-03-05,11354371,Bashar Ahmed,Excellent stay here. Mario as a very well decorated house with antiques and art all around the place. Hardly knew he was there the entire time I was there. Location is a convienient 5 min walk from train station. 
31464,10784012,2014-03-07,12386716,Shaina,"The other wonderful reviews that you've read about Mario and his home don't do him justice.  He is a phenomenal host, so warm and friendly, and willing to give you information about how to make the most out of your time in Rome.  And his home is phenomenal.  The artwork is outstanding, the place is wonderfully kept, and frankly, it was a real pleasure to stay there.  Further, it's so easy to get too.  It was relaxing and peaceful.  I wholeheartedly recommend Mario's home to anyone wanting to stay in Rome.  Thanks, Mario for a wonderful time."
31464,10892444,2014-03-11,12696476,Adam,"Mario's apartment was perfect for us, very close to the metro in a very quiet part of town.  He was very gracious with his place, highly recommend!"

31464,11241832,2014-03-26,4788244,Seng Kiong,"A charming and cozy home within walking distance from the metro station, which is a short ride to the centre of Rome. The home is tastefully decorated with antiques collected from all over the world. A comfortable place to return to after a long day out in the Roman centre. Mario is responsive and very helpful, ensuring that our stay was comfortable and we were well fed during breakfast. The complimentary wine was a nice touch (Mario is a sommelier, hence the wine selection was excellent).  I will return to Mario's home if I'm gien the oportunity to visit Rome again! :)"
31464,11472058,2014-04-04,7715690,Hoai,"We had a wonderful stay at Mario's home. He welcomed us cordially with a bottle of wine. Breakfast supply was ok. He left his whole apartment to us so that we felt like home. Besides, Mario is very friendly and always caring. Recommended!"

31464,12215185,2014-04-26,13184100,Kati,"My friend and I spent two nights at Mario's apartment, which is very comfortable and clean. Mario was a wonderful host - provided us with all needed information and was perfectly accessible. We especially appreciated his flexibility and the hospitality with which he welcomed us. 
Moreover, Mario provided the ingredients for a perfect breakfast. We would definitely recommend Mario's place to our friends.  "
31464,12389614,2014-05-01,2079843,Juliana,"We truly enjoyed Mario's excellent hospitality during our stay here. He was always prompt to reply any of your queries and was very accommodating. 
The whole apartment is beautifully decorated and our bedroom had a comfortable  bed where we enjoyed a pleasant nights' sleep. His apartment is very close the the Line B Metro stop which made commuting easy.
Highly recommended! Thank you Mario!"

Nous sommes arrivÃ©s vers minuit et Mario nous a accueilli avec le sourire, que dire de plus.
L'emplacement est idÃ©al, Ã  2 pas d'un mÃ©tro qui nous emmÃ¨ne Ã  la station termini en 20 min Ã  peine.
L'appartement est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able, c'est un petit cocon amÃ©nagÃ© avec beaucoup de goÃ»t et de finesse.
Si je devais retourner Ã  Rome, j'irais sans hÃ©siter une seconde chez Mario."
31464,12685858,2014-05-08,12805935,Renae,"My husband and I had 3 fabulous days in Rome. We stayed at Marioâs Home and really enjoyed it. Itâs fairly close to the Metro station Monte Tiburtini from where you have easy access to the heart  of Rome. The best part though is the experience of hospitality you will gain by staying with Mario. He is very welcoming and open, and you can feel how much he loves making your trip a great experience. Not only did he go the extra mile to provide for breakfast, he shared his passion of wine with us,  gave us tips on what not to miss, where to have the best eating experience, as well  a map for city navigation. Being a very creative individual I truly appreciated the environment he created for himself and his guests, and in the case you will be staying with Mario as well, bring your sense of curiosity and let yourself be inspired. You will never know what one of his displayed artifacts or a book from his library will lead you to. Thank you  Mario for opening your home to us and making our stay such a pleasurable experience. 
"
31464,12810579,2014-05-12,11213925,Sarah,"With clear, specific directions graciously provided by Mario, his airbnb was easy to locate, only a couple minutes walk from a metro station. Mario greeted us with a smile, a bottle of wine and a quick run through of the places to see in Rome, before he left us to have privacy for the full weekend. Though not located in the centre of town, being so near to a metro station made it easy to travel wherever we wanted to go in Rome. We only stayed for two nights, but felt very comfortable (the bed is GREAT, and having a washing machine was a huge plus) and had a brilliant time."
31464,13239172,2014-05-23,1503641,Adrien,"Appartement bien situÃ©,  a environ 10 min de mÃ©tro de termini.
L'appart en lui mÃªme est a 2-3 min de marche de la station de mÃ©tro Monti Tiburtini.

Comme indiquÃ© dans l'annonce Mario est dans lâappartement mais il est trÃ¨s discret et sympathique.

C'est une bonne adresse pour visiter Rome, et Ã  un bon tarif, surtout que Mario fournit les Ã©lÃ©ments du petit dej (pain, confitures, cafÃ© etc), les serviettes de bain pour la SDB.

La chambre dispose d'un grand lit (peut Ãªtre un peu mou mais c'est trÃ¨s subjectif).

Le logement dispose d'un wifi, et Mario nous a mÃªme proposÃ© d'utiliser son ordinateur si besoin.

Merci pour l'accueil!

31464,13533247,2014-05-30,2930401,Luciana,"Our experience with Mario was absolutely perfect! He is great, very considerate and amiable. He received us with a fine bottle of wine, left us generous breakfast and never used the common spaced when we were around so that we had our privacy. The apartment is beautiful, Mario is a man of refined taste so in his place you feel like royalty. Communication was good too. Mario definitely sets the bar high for all other Airbnb hosts. Thank you, Mario!"
31464,13733385,2014-06-03,12297065,Perrine,"Mario's home is an incredible curiosities cabinet. A very nice place to explore and to enjoy. Mario is very friendly and thoughtful. We had a ""home sweet home"" all set up and ... a bottle of Chianti waiting for us at our arrival. It is located a few metro stations from the Collosseum, which make it a great place for a week end or vacations in Roma. And you have a nice veggie wine bar closed to his place. "
31464,14075508,2014-06-11,1435605,Hannah,We had the best time at Mario's flat.  Mario gave us good advice on how to get where we needed to go.  Dinner on his patio was a pleasure of peace after dealing with the crowds of tourists that are Rome in the summer. We highly recommend staying in this lovely flat and charming host.
31464,14278102,2014-06-16,2586638,Valer,"When we first arrived the directions that Mario had sent us were wonderful we were able to easily find the house. And then Mario was very hospitable he showed us the house, the rooms. Everything was clean, unique style and very beautiful. He even left a bottle of wine for us which was a great welcome gift. During our stay he mostly left us alone and we enjoyed the house. In the house we found maps, and we had wifi for everything we were looking for. Overall a great experience and was worth it!
"
31464,14902457,2014-06-29,12930889,Julie," We thoroughly enjoyed our week in Rome as both a working and relaxing ""vacation."" Mario's home played a large role in that. It is comfortable and visually fascinating, (he's a very busy and creative guy) yet has everything we needed to do our own work when we had to. Mario graciously turned his home over to us, but was always available if we had questions or needed directions. In short, Mario and his home are nothing less than amazing. He made our Rome trip, brief as it was, extra special. We would stay there again without question!"
31464,15054119,2014-07-01,13002619,Dasha,"Mario's home is incredible and he is a great host! It is very close to the metro station (which was only about 10 minutes away from the main station, Termini), it has cute little bars, shops and fruit markets close by, and it is definitely in a safe neighbourhood. 
The flat is clean, well kept, and Mario is a very welcoming host. He also encourages the use of common areas (a wonderful living room, the balcony and the kitchen). 
The guest room is also very clean, tidy and uncluttered. There is plenty of space for your belongings. The private bathroom is also very clean and spacious. The flat overall is a sight in itself, very creatively decorated and artistic yet does not feel cluttered. 
What I loved about Mario and his girlfriend is they did a great job being informative and helpful, yet also allowed us to have our space and did not make us feel like we were in the way.
Thanks Mario :) "

We felt safe walking home among locals after getting off the last train at 12:30am. Only a 5 minute walk anyway.
10+ pizza places and cafÃ©s just around the block for the truly local experience. We recommend the Cornetti e CaffÃ© on Monti Tiburtini 540 ! Fresh coffee and pastry for under 2 euros!

The building : 8th floor with elevators. Big place, strong AC, has kitchen use and Mario prepared little local snacks for us each day. Queen size bed is comfy. Home decor is loaded with unique and interesting art pieces. 


All in all a great place about 30 min from the city. Thanks Mario!"

31464,16971415,2014-08-05,13183918,Jia Xin,Strongly recommend Mario's Home! You'll get what you see and even more. The apartment is located only 2 minutes to metro station which can reach Colosseo by same line. Also it's a really local compound so you can learn Italian lifestyle. The apartment is on the 8 floor and is fully equipped and well decorated. Mario's is really kind-hearted and considerate. He helped me a lot with my journey tickets and provided various food and beverage. Thanks to Mario's Home that made my journey began smoothly. 
31464,17291413,2014-08-10,2428532,Clare,"Mario is truly an excellent host and his apartment is lovely and extremely clean. The breakfast items and coffee he provided were much appreciated and were a very nice touch. The apartment is just a block from a metro station making the historical center of Rome easily accessible, and it is located in a nice residential area. I would certainly stay here again if I were in Rome. Thank you for everything, Mario!"
31464,17552983,2014-08-14,12808876,Ashley,"Mario's apartment was an exceptional combination of art and comfortability. He was a wonderful host, gave great directions, and was very open and willing to help with anything my husband and I needed. He borrowed us maps and pointed out the best spots to explore around Rome. The Metro allowed for easy travel between Mario's home and Rome attractions --though a little far away for my liking. Overall, a nice experience."
31464,17927357,2014-08-19,10835626,Marcos,This was my first time using Airbnb and I was a little nervous. Mario communicated well before my arrival and even picked me up from the train station. The apartment was nice and clean and Mario was very thorough in explaining the apartment and city. The apartment is a 1 minute walk from the metro station. Overall the experience was great! 
31464,18497517,2014-08-27,5921458,Kelie,"I didn't get to see much of Mario, but he was very nice when we met and checked in to see me whether everything was ok. His place is great and just a short walk (one block) away from the metro and can get you easily to the main attractions. His place is very cozy and the best thing is breakfast is provided as well as use of laundry machine. I highly recommend his place!!"
31464,18952495,2014-09-03,12034766,Urana,"Mario was the best host everyone could ask for. Due to the delay of our flight and luggages, we arrived 2 hours later than we spoke but he was still there waiting for us. He provided all information you would need to explore Rome as well as excellent breakfast. He has even given us a bottle of Italian Prosecco as a gift.  The location was only 2 mins from the metro station which made our trip so convenient. Thanks Mario for having us! We enjoyed our stay so much. "
31464,19454247,2014-09-13,12937561,Louise,"Mario was very kind and helpful.  He welcomed us with a bottle of wine and lots of  information on sights we were interested in.
His apartment is even prettier than the pictures; clean and very comfortable.
The location was excellent.  Very close to metro line and we always felt safe coming back in the evenings.
Mario was out of town when we left.  His friend Nadia made arrangement for an early morning taxi ride to the airport, which we greatly appreciated.
I highly recommend Mario's home.  "
31464,19770840,2014-09-18,11636156,Elise,"We booked our stay in Rome with Mario because of his great reviews - and our expectations were certainly met. We arrived 2 hours late at night but his friend Nadia warmly greeted us. This was our first time using airbnb and it was a great experience. Everything was very clean and comfortable, and the big bed and the air conditioning were lifesavers after a long day walking in the hot sun. I can't say enough good things about Mario and Nadia who made us feel very at home, and would definitely stay here again. Thank you Mario and Nadia!"

O apartamento tem uma decoracao muito bonita, bem organizado, limpo e dispoe de tudo o que precisamos durante nossa estadia. Fica bem proximo ao metro, o que facilita o acesso, alem disso existem restaurantes e mercados proximos.

Mario foi muito gentil e nos atendeu prontamente a todas nossas necessidades. Alem de tudo, nos presenteou com uma garrafa de vinho quando chegamos.

O apartamento do Mario vale muito a pena, excelente custo beneficio! Recomendamos!!"
31464,20488771,2014-09-30,13008139,Lynn,"Mario could not have been a better host.  When we arrived he met us at the Metro station - which is only a block from his home.  He even helped with our luggage, which was very nice of him.  He opened his home to us and made sure we knew it was our home for the duration of our stay.  He showed us where to buy the best pizza, groceries and made himself available to us by telephone 24/7 - should we need him for anything.  His home far exceeded the listing description.  It was clean and beautifully decorated with his original artwork and sculptures.  We were so pleased to find screens on the balcony door and kitchen window - which allowed us to thoroughly enjoy the cool evening air and beautiful Rome sunsets.  The air conditioner in our bedroom was a welcome treat.  Our private bathroom allowed us to settle in like we were at home.  We absolutely loved staying with Mario and highly recommend his home to all travellers.  He made our wedding anniversary / vacation absolutely perfect in every way."

Living at the quiet and neat Apt. filled with artistic atmosphere, eating rich breatfast and walking to the metro only for 5 min and etc.  All made our journey much more enjoyable at Rome.
Thanks again  Mario!"
31464,21458964,2014-10-18,26027,Stephanie,"My second time staying at Mario's home was just as wonderful as the first time! Mario is a helpful, gracious host and his home is truly a work of art. I was in Rome for business meetings and had very long days, and I was always happy to return to Mario's home in the evening because it is such a relaxing, pleasing space. I hope to return to Rome again before too long and stay at Mario's."

31464,21942387,2014-10-27,19465409,Alan,"Mario was very welcoming, friendly and generous. We were given good advice about Rome and local restaurants. Mario was only briefly in apartment during our stay and kept a low profile so he would not intrude. He left a complimentary bottle of wine for us and allowed us to full use of his personally stocked kitchen.
His apartment is beautifully decorated and very comfortable. It is in a quiet suburb, only a few hundred meters from the Metro.
I would recommend Mario's apartment to anyone. We had a very relaxing few days in Rome which were helped by Mario's lovely personality.
Thank you Mario
Yvonne & Alan"
31464,22142447,2014-10-31,223813,Anne,"Mario provided us with all necessary information upfront thus we could easily find his appartment and he was waiting for us on the day of our arrival. It was a warm welcome with cookies and tea and we immediately liked his cosy appartment. Mario gave us a few hints and he prepared a whole bunch of travelling guides we could us in addition to our own guide.
Mario's home is in perfect condition and our sleeping room had a double bed big enought for me and my sun.
There are lots of shops, supermarkets and restaurants in the closer vicinity of Mario's home and it's only 5 minutes walking to the nearest Metro station ""Monti Tiburtini"". 
We usually took a daypass for 6,-EUR thus we could use Metro, bus  and all other public transportation systems for 24h. 
From Monti Tiburtini to Colloseum takes about 20 minutes by Metro.
We really enjoyed staying at Mario's Home, and should we come back to Rome once, we hope that Mario is still on airbnb. "

Mario hat uns sehr freundlich empfangen und einige Tips gegeben, danach hatten wir die Wohnung fuer uns. Bei Fragen konnte ich ihn telefonisch erreichen. Wir sind gluecklich das wir unsere Naechte in Marios Wohnung verbracht haben. Es gab auch einen Einblick in die Gebiete ohne Touristen, die Menschen waren alle sehr freundlich. Empfehlenswert!"

Highly recommended!

Embora doente (esperamos que recupere rapidamente), nÃ£o deixou de nos dar todas as indicaÃ§Ãµes necessÃ¡rias e prestar todo o apoio por nÃ³s solicitado. PertÃ­ssimo da estaÃ§Ã£o de metro e somente a seis paragens da estaÃ§Ã£o principal, Termini, este espaÃ§o, extremamente bem decorado e cuidado, permitiu que nos sentÃ­ssemos completamente Ã  vontade, pelo que o recomendamos vivamente, AH!, claro, ofereceu-nos a jÃ¡ famosa garrafa de vinho que foi o acompanhamento ideal numa das nossas refeiÃ§Ãµes."

Throughout the 3 days, Mario made us feel at home: the room (especially the bed) was cosy and comfortable, the kitchen was stocked up with food and coffee that filled our hungry stomachs in the morning, and the toilet was spacious and clean. Mario also took the time to explain to us the directions to the different attractions in Rome and lent us useful maps and guide books on the city. We also enjoyed our conversations with him as he opened our eyes to the Italian culture. At the same time, Mario was very mindful of our privacy.

Overall, Mario is a very warm and generous host! Thank you, Mario!

Rachel & Vincent "
31464,23771033,2014-12-09,24315799,Christa,"We had a great stay at Mario's. He left us the most delicious red wine I've ever tasted, basket of fresh fruit, and great continental breakfast foods. Although his place isn't in the center of Rome it is extremely close to the metro, and we found it easy to connect. Unfortunately we didn't have the pleasure of meeting Mario, but I think it was due to the change of times me and my friend said we would be coming. Which...he was exceedingly flexible with us, allowing us to show up much later than we had first proposed and providing us w gluten free options for breakfast at the very last minute. I recommend Mario's place for anyone wanting a clean, artistic, and easy access to and from many sites in Rome :) Thanks Mario!"
31464,23991360,2014-12-16,22073676,Wil Fred,Mario has been a great host. Even before our arrival he gave us a warm welcome with good travel information. He has a very nice apartment close to the Metro station with a cosy room very well kept and very nice decorated. Mario can tell enthusiastic about the things to see in Rome and his work as an artist.

The apartment is very artisticly decorated and is clean and spacy. We had full access to the kitchen, bathroom, livingroom and bedroom which really made it an excellent B&B. We have been staying at Mario's home for a week, to us it gets full marks! It is a wonderful place to stay. Very close to a supermarket, several pizzarias, the station Monti Tiburtina and a park. 

Mario is a very good, kind and charmant host. He perfectly understands the needs of his guests.  We even received a bottle Prosecco, which was very kind of him. "
31464,25138696,2015-01-07,8859725,Lexi,"Mario is absolutely nice and friendly to my cousin and me. His flat is clean and artistic, the most important is that the place is quite near to subway. I felt so glad to stay at Mario's place during we were in Rome.  "

It couldn't have been a better place to stay in such a historical city Rome, we felt like sleeping in a museum hahaha thank you Mario! :D"
31464,28867789,2015-03-31,26216852,Matthias,"Mario ist nicht nur ein sehr zuvorkommender Gastgeber, sondern auch ein hervorragender KÃ¼nstler!

Die U-Bahn ist 3 Minuten entfernt und mit etwas GlÃ¼ck ist man in 15 Minuten im Zentrum. FÃ¼r uns war es der ideale Standort und wir wÃ¼rden gerne wieder kommen. Absolute Empfehlung!!!"

Mario er meget hjÃ¦lpsom og gÃ¸r hvad han kan for at sikre en god oplevelse for gÃ¦sterne.  Mario sagde: ""I love hosting"".  Med alt hvad hna gjorde for os, beviste han, at udsagnet er korrekt.
Boligen ligger tÃ¦t pÃ¥ metro, og pÃ¥ den mÃ¥de kun 15 minutter fra cantrum.

is like being part of a family.
Mario has a great and save appartment that can be used as a base to explore Rome and its near public transport "
31464,31629455,2015-05-08,10414974,Tom,"Our stay with Mario was wonderful! He was welcoming and warm, and helped get us oriented to Rome and how to navigate the city. His place is very convenient for accessing the subway, what we found to be the transportation of choice for getting around. The room was comfy and quiet, a nice sanctuary at the end of the day dealing with the hustle and bustle of downtown. Given the opportunity we'd stay with Mario again if in Rome."
31464,31873777,2015-05-11,26762877,Resa,"We had a wonderful stay at Mario's. He communicated well and responded quickly to all our emails. He was very flexible with our check in time as our flight was delayed and we arrived 8 hours later then expected. His home was comfortable, welcoming and very clean. Close to the subway and in a great location. Only regret was not meeting Mario as we were never home at same time. We would definitely stay there again."
31464,32047604,2015-05-13,26447755,Jon,"Mario had a good backup as he was out of town and had friend wait for us, much appreciated as our flight was delayed to Rome.
His place is truely an artist's haven, great art.  The location is great if you do not want to be in a tourist mecca, you can mix with the locals and get a real feel to live as an Italian in Rome.
The Metro is an easy walk and will get you into Termini within 20 mins.
Mario's local eatery recommendations (included in the listing) is a brilliant idea.  I'd recommend La Margarita as a place for an evening meal.  The portions are large so chose carefully and the prices are very resonable.

Wir waren zu zweit in Rom bei Mario zu Besuch und es hat alles super geklappt und die Wohnung war wie wir sie uns vorgestellt haben. Die Check-in / Check out Zeit konnten wir uns selber aussuchen und er war total flexibel. Insgesamt war die Wohnung und unser Zimmer sehr sauber und ordentlich hergerichtet. Mario war sehr selten zuhause bzw haben wir uns hÃ¤ufig verpasst, deswegen hatten wir meistens die komplette Wohnung fÃ¼r uns. Er ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit, wir wÃ¼rden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen. 

We (mother and daughter) came to visit Rome and stayed with Mario. Everything went well, the check in/out time was flexible and Mario was very supportive. The apartment was clean and the bathroom really modern. He himself wasn't very often at home (or we missed him while we weren't at home) so it's like having the whole apartment on your own. As everything was great we would definitely come back on our next trip to Rome. Thanks a lot for your hospitality! "
31464,33777902,2015-06-01,82465,Mira,"""We stayed a few days at his apartment and Mario was very helpful and kind. Even though we didn't see him often, he was always quick to response our questions whenever we (Hidden by Airbnb) him. The room was beautiful decorated. Bathroom was modern and spotless clean. It was a hotel standard. He let us use his kitchen and there was a dish washer! It took 20mins to terminal station but you wont find it too long as his apartment was very close to metro. The neighborhood was quiet and there were many grocery shops around. You must try the nearby restaurant which was recommended by him. It was much better than a lot of restaurants in the tourist spots. Mario, thank you so much for everything. We will sure come back when we visit Rome again. """
31464,34281797,2015-06-07,26031461,Shirley,Mario's home was very  comfortable and the air conditioning on the hot Roman nights was really appreciated. We did not meet Mario this visit but look forward to that when we return later this month.
31464,34631375,2015-06-10,30750088,Mitchell,"Mario's home in Rome was amazing! It was clean, beautifully designed and a really unique space. It is in a convenient location to explore Rome, just a 5 minute walk from the train which is six stops from the Coliseum. Mario provided us with maps and directions and suggestions for Rome when we arrived. He also gave us a bottle of wine and breakfast sweets for our stay! 

Unfortunately we accidentally stained one of his bath towels while we were staying there but hopefully this hasn't soured his experience, as we know ours was great! Thanks Mario, I highly recommend him for anyone exploring Rome!"

Mario is super welcoming and nice. He showed us the map of Rome and he suggested a few places that he thought might be awesome for us to visit. I would definitely go again if I were to visit Rome again. I am truly sorry that me and my friend caused a lot of trouble for you, Mario. Thank you for coming home for us with the key! Hope some day we can meet again and talk more about art!

31464,52727863,2015-11-01,36852666,Abhishek,"Mario has been by far the best Airbnb host I have come across. In addition to providing a comfortable stay in a beautifully decorated apartment, he easily went above and beyond in his expression of what hosting can mean. He set new standards for how accommodating and generous a host can be. For example, he was just like a friend and surprised us by picking us from Roma Termini station and loaded us with all the information we needed to get going in Rome - sort of a 30 mins crash course in the train ride!

Well that's Mario. Like I said, a well decorated apartment and provides a warm atmosphere. He is a multi-talented individual and you'd see it all around you when you step in. Apartment's bathroom is renovated and modern - easily beats a W or Westin bathroom. Full access to an Apple iMac, kitchen, snacks AND wine too!

For you - I guess one of the next most important thing as a traveler is the locality. My wife and I were quite happy with the commute to key points of the city. Keeping aside the rush hour of Rome metro, its a 15 mins ride to Ancient Rome and Vatican City is another 10 mins after changing a train. I had no issues with the location.

There is local market and decent eating places on the way back from metro station to Mario's home (station is 5 mins away). 

Strongly recommend his place - cos you'll not just have a memorable stay, you'll know a great host!"
31464,54676006,2015-11-22,14344348,Paul,"Cant say enough! His reviews really do speak for themselves. Great location half a block from Metro. 15 minutes to Coloseum. Nice eclectic apartment we basically had to ourselves. Very cosy with a lovely brand new bathroom. Mario gave us a 15 minute Rome in a nutshell debrief and then let us do our thing. He was accessible 24/7 but left us to explore this magnificent city. So friendly and knowledgeable. For the price, location and host you cannot go wrong! Thanks Mario. Paul, Victoria, Canada"

When I arrived at Mario's home, I was welcomed by his beautiful wife Derya. She showed me where everything was + explained how it worked. This was my first Airbnb experience. I can not tell you enough to how grateful I am for meeting and staying with Mario and Derya for my first time. I feel like I got a glimpse of the Italian life, food, and language. They are both so loving, talented, warm, funny, and creative. I also had the pleasure of meeting their friends who are hilarious.

The home is located very close to the metro, so it was easy to commute into the city. The bed sleeps great, it's quiet at night, and made for a sound sleep. The breakfast was yummy. I love fruits and tea, so it was perfect. They have great information about the city, maps, and books to look into if you're interested.

Honestly, they've set the bar so high for others to come. The current airbnb I'm staying in doesn't even compare. I missed them as soon as I got on the train to head to Salerno. I felt so at home in Rome. Me staying with them helped me fall in love with Roma even more. 

Thank you both for your hospitality, openness, and welcoming me into what felt like my home for close to a month. Words can't even express how appreciative I am.

You're the best! Grazie Mille! Abbracci a tutti e due! Until we meet again. Ciao."
31464,68888001,2016-04-07,12043705,Ana Maria,"My partner and I had an absolutely perfect 5 nights stay in Rome and that was also thanks to us being hosted by Mario and his wife Dariya. The apartment is lovely, filled with interesting art objects, very clean and comfortable. We had exclusive use of the guests bathroom and our hosts were very generous in allowing us to use the kitchen and all the supplies we needed, which helped us a lot with sticking to our own culinary habits. The bed is very nice, we had really good night sleep, especially after we realised that we really needed to keep the window open as Rome was warm, even if it was only the beginning of April. Mario and Dariya were discreet and they tried to makes us feel like the entire apartment was ours and Mario showed us locations on the map and gave us a few tips about various things to see and do. The apartment is outside the centre of the city but it's basically only a few metro stops away from all the sightseeing. It was nice coming back to somewhere quiet after all the noise of the town. There are also fruit and vegetables shops, a fish shop and a supermarket all very near to the apartment and the metro stop is literally just across the street, so all in all very handy. What can I say? I'll definitely stay again in Mario's place when and if we come back to Rome."
31464,69586002,2016-04-11,23092523,Conny,"Mario's home is beautifully decorated.  We met up with Mario's wife who kindly showed us the Metro lines which is our main transport from Mario's apartment.  We met Mario and his wife on the first day evening.  After that, they kindly allowed us lots of privacy as we did see them after the first evening and it seems like we have the whole apartment to ourselves. The apartment is clean, tastefully decorated and the bathroom is separate from the bedroom but is private to us.  We were asked to help ourselves to the food in the kitchen for breakfast but in our case, we preferred the cafes in Rome.   The Metro is convenient however brace yourself for crowded trains at peak hours in the evening.    "
31464,72760639,2016-05-04,14247656,Shahram,"My stay at Mario's place was excellent. He and his wife are very hospitable and kind. Their flat is very inviting and the room was clean and tidy. It is well located, close to metro line and was easily accessible for us. My best experience at Airbnb so far."
31464,76184596,2016-05-25,55770159,Kyle,"Mario and Daria  were wonderful hosts - very kind and helpful. They made us feel immediately at home in their beautiful apartment. The kitchen is well equipped, there is a little balcony where you can enjoy your breakfast, and the room is even more beautiful than the  photos with its own ensuite bathroom. The neighborhood is  very convenient, with an easy metro that is a 1 min walk from the apartment.  They gave us great recommendations of places to go and things to do. We could not have been happier with the entire experience!"
31464,77444800,2016-05-31,66789702,Johanna,"We had a nice vacation at mario's flat. The room was very clean and nice furnished. 
At the first day we got a lot of information about rome from him and his wife. 
It was awesome that we could reach the underground within 5 min by foot. To the centre of rome the train took 15 minutes. 

Thx for the little welcome gift to Mario.
Anytime again"

Er gab uns nÃ¼tzliche Informationen zu unserem Aufenthalt und wertvolle Empfehlungen zu den SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten in Rom. Unser Zimmer und das Bad waren sehr schÃ¶n und sehr sauber.

Wir fÃ¼hlten uns wie Zuhause und kommen gerne wieder - vielen Dank Mario!

The apartment is on the main metro line and very convenient. It is just far enough away from the city so you can totally relax form a hectic sightseeing schedule. It truly is a home from home, exceptionally 'Quirky' but comfortable. I would heartily recommend Mario's to anyone I know. "
31464,84116687,2016-07-05,46633450,Pradeep,We really enjoyed our stay at Mario's home and he was a great host. The location is very convenient and less than 10 minute walk to the Monti Tiburtini station on the B-Subway. From there one can commute to any place in Rome. It is a residential area with several eateries in the neighborhood. Derya (Mario's wife) helped us plan our visit to Rome and the sweet couple made their beautiful home available to us during our stay.
31464,85046193,2016-07-10,16787381,Wadeea,Mario and Darya were fantastic hosts. Very hospitable and knowledge. They got us off on the right foot in Rome. Great place for first timers or anyone for that matter. They have a wonderful home. 
31464,85708945,2016-07-12,15130843,Margreet,De vrouw van Mario leidde ons door het appartement. Er was ontbijt en een fles prosecco.
31464,87372590,2016-07-19,1525515,Regina,I highly recommend staying here! This was my second stay at Mario's place and it was perfect once again. He has switched the rooms and put in a brand new beautiful private bathroom which made it even better! I love being able to take a short Metro ride into the center of Rome and then be able to step away and have some quiet at night. As a solo traveler I have always felt safe here as well.

C'Ã©tait mas premiÃ¨re expÃ©rience AirBnb en Italy et nous sommes trÃ¨s ravies.  L'appartement est trÃ¨s proche du mÃ©tro, j'ai lu des commentaires qui disent 10 minutes, et ben non, de la station Monti-Triburtini (MÃ©toro B) Ã  lâappartement de Mario il y a exactement 3mn chrono. Surtout que la station et Ã  10mn de la gare Termini (centre de Rome).  Comme dÃ©crit dans les photos le logis est trÃ¨s propre est bien amÃ©nagÃ© avec une trÃ¨s belle dÃ©coration. Mario et Daria vous mettent directement Ã  l'aise et vous propose beaucoup de service: petit dÃ©j, dÃ©j/diner, utilisation internet et pc de la maison. Daria nous a directement expliquÃ© sur une carte de Rome les endroits Ã  visiter pour ne pas perdre le temps (limitÃ© par le temps). Avant notre dÃ©part ils m'ont rÃ©servÃ© un Taxi et ils sont levÃ©s ce matin malgrÃ© que c'est un dimanche Ã  7h15 pour nous dire au revoir. 
Au final, je vous conseille fortement d'y aller chez Mario et Daria car comme nous, vous n'allez surement pas regretter votre sÃ©jour chez des gens qui aiment recevoir et partager avant tout. C'est cent mille fois mieux qu'un hotel. Encore merci beaucoup Mario et Daria pour le temps consacrÃ© pour nous.

Mario also gave us a city map and helped out with the metro system and pointed out interesting places to visit in the city. He also helped out with the taxi to the airport. We will recommend Mario's place to others who plan to go to Rome :-)

31464,110890716,2016-10-29,28740594,Han,Fijne plek. Mario heeft gezorgd voor een warm welkom. 100 meter van het Metro-station (6 stops naar Termini). Je mag de hele woning gebruiken en zelf stellen Mario en zijn vriendin zich heel bescheiden op. Er is gezorgd voor voldoende proviand om je ontbijt te maken en bij aankomst stond er een fles Spumante klaar! Echt een fijne plek als je Rome wilt bezoeken met in een straal van een paar honderd meter (gebruik Tripadvisor) genoeg restaurants in de buurt. Helemaal goed dus!

31464,161232638,2017-06-17,126611084,Simone,"FÃ¼r meinen Sohn, 13 J. und mich war die Unterkunft perfekt fÃ¼r 5 Tage. Klimatisiertes Zimmer im 8. Stock, nur 5 Minuten zur Metro, die ab M. T. nie Ã¼berfÃ¼llt war. Kleine Shops gibt es auch in der StraÃe um Obst, GemÃ¼se,...zu kaufen. Selbst ein paar schicke und bequeme Schuhe habe ich gefunden. Wir wurden von seiner Frau freundlich empfangen und haben gleich ein paar Tipps bekommen. Rompass ist auch nicht erforderlich bei 1,50 Ticketkosten pro Person/Strecke. Als BegrÃ¼Ãung gab es eine Flasche  weiÃen Wein aus Rom, war sehr lecker. WÃ¼rde auf jeden Fall bei meiner nÃ¤chsten Romreise wieder bei Mario und seiner Familie buchen."
31464,163683008,2017-06-25,21834841,Priscilla,Mario's house is very comfortable and mario was extremely prompt with communication. Very close to metro stop and nice to be away from busy city area! Mario's wife was helpful with info to navigate Rome. No hesitation in recommending this place to others! 
31464,167052330,2017-07-05,69637845,Thorben,"Die Unterkunft von Mario kÃ¶nnen wir rundum die volle Punktzahl geben. Ich habe bereits mehrfach airbnb ""betrieben"" und bin bislang nie auf ""echte"" Gastgeber getroffen. Bei Mario hingegen trifft man ihn, seine Frau und die vor kurzem geborene Tochter an. Das eigene Zimmer mit eigenem Bad ist klimatisiert. Im KÃ¼hlschrank bekommt ihr ein extra Fach zugeteilt, welches bereits mit netten Sachen gefÃ¼llt ist. Brot stand ebenfalls fÃ¼r uns bereit. Man fÃ¼hlt sich sehr willkommen. StÃ¶rend ist vielleicht, dass das Bad mittels einer GlastÃ¼r abgetrennt ist...das lÃ¤sst euch euren Partner unter UmstÃ¤nden von einer neuen Seite erleben :-)
Andernfalls kann man natÃ¼rlich auch einfach den Raum verlassen!
Die Lage der Wohnung ist nicht sehr zentral, allerdings lernt man so mal eine Wohngegend in einer GroÃstadt wie Rom kennen. Mit der Bahn ist man zÃ¼gig in der Innenstadt. Wer mit dem Auto reist, findet dazu noch kostenlose ParkplÃ¤tze vor. Unter dem Strich ist noch der Ã¼beraus faire Preis zu erwÃ¤hnen. FÃ¼r meine nÃ¤chste Rom-Reise habe ich die Wohnung von Marco auf dem Zettel! Es stand Ã¼brigens noch ein Gastgeschenk fÃ¼r uns bereit :-)
Wenn ihr das lest, dann denkt doch an die beiden und bringt ihnen eine typische Kleinigkeit aus eurer Region mit! "
31464,168292102,2017-07-09,113022232,Julian,"Had an excellent time staying at Mario's house during my stay at Rome. Very quick walk from the train station which helped, and was given a very informative run down on everything from his wife upon arrival . Will definately be recommending for friends and family for future travels. Thank you very much. "
31464,169919583,2017-07-14,130244556,Randi,We've been to 4 countries in Europe for our wedding anniversary date and Mario's home was definitely the best airbnb so far. They gave us a warm welcome with a complimentary bottle of white wine which is totally great! He offered us food just in case we forget to buy in the grocery store. His home and Mario being a host really deserves a  5 star rating. Highly recommended for those who plans of visiting rome. Thanks Mario and until next time!
31464,171983467,2017-07-19,106148119,RocÃ­o,La habitaciÃ³n es muy cÃ³moda! Tiene baÃ±o privado. Mario nos ofreciÃ³ la cocina y nosotros la podÃ­amos usar a cualquier hora; ademÃ¡s nos tenÃ­a un espacio en el refrigerador con algunas cosas para comer por lo que el desayuno que tomamos todos los dÃ­as fueron de las mismas cosas que nos ofreciÃ³. El barrio es muy tranquilo y estÃ¡ frente a la estaciÃ³n de metro monte tiburtina. Nuestra estancia ahÃ­ estuvo muy cÃ³moda.

The separate room including an extra bathroom made us feel like in a hotel. Big plus was the kitchen we could use to cook and the balcony where we enjoyed our meals with beautiful sunsets. Mario is a great host: he picked us up at Termini, had some basic food for us and explained the tourist-map in a uncomplicated way with good tips.

When Mario met us, he showed us where everything was and showed us points of interest on a map and how to get there via metro. Metro is close, which was great.

We totally recommend Marios house if you are looking for somewhere quiet to spend your time in Rome!
31464,261362374,2018-05-06,2286494,Claudia,"Mario and Daria went out of their way to make us feel at home with them. We shared the living space - dining area, kitchen and sitting room. However, we had our own private bedroom with a very comfortable queen size bed and an en suite private bathroom. Their artistic decor throughout their apartment is exceptional. They were warm, welcoming and very helpful with questions.
 It's an easy 15 minute Metro ride into Rome""s city centre. If you need to change from the blue to the red line - add another 5-7 minutes. The metro is a wonderful way to get around in the city. Uber, once you get into the city, is a great asset as well since the metro puts you in the vicinity of where you want to go but streets and directions get dicey once you're inside the city. It seems that street names and numbers are optional or streets change names randomly."

I love the details of the room and bathroom... makes you feel like youâve checked in a hotel. As a host, Mario is very pleasant, friendly, accommodating, helpful and generous. He even had food waiting for us at the kitchen and ref. We had fruits, breads, cookies, eggs, milk, hotdogs, cheese and all sorts of snacks and coffee and tea was unlimited in his very chic nook/coffee table. We really enjoyed our stay in his place.

The room is very nice as you can see on the pictures.
I recommand Mario's, we had a very good time. Thank you !"

The cappuccino and breakfast provided every morning was fantastic. I was traveling part of the time on my own and Mario and his wife helped me with everything I had questions about, no language barrier. I felt like I was part of their family. I stayed with them for ten days. Their location is great, very close to train station and gated community. I would highly recommend Mario's home to everyone. When I come to Rome again I will definately stay at Mario's. It's your ""home"" away from home!!!!  Thank you Mario and your lovely wife for making my Italy trip wonderful!!!!!"

The only thing is the bathroom door is see through so if you are sharing with a significant other or a friend, you need to be comfortable seeing them using the toliet. The sliding door doesnât stay closed the whole way.

Did really like the blackout blinds from the bathroom and really liked the rain shower head! Hosts were both really nice and provided water, snacks, and breakfast!"

Amazing journey to Rome accommodation is clean secure in a nice suburban part of town and even downtown is not that far with the Blue metro line. View is amazing from the balcony. Especially the sunset. Mario even surprised us with a nice glass of Italian wine. Unfortunately we only met with Mario's lovely family through video call. Wish we could have stayed couple more days.

I am a solo female traveler and never felt unsafe in the area even later at night especially since itâs so close to the metro. I highly recommend this place for your visit to Rome!"

31464,536297827,2019-09-26,100289209,Pei Ven,"Mario's place is a very fabulous place to stay when visit Rome. My fiance and I had a very enjoyable and pleasant stay at Mario's accomodation.

Firstly, the hosts are very friendly and helpful. Mario wife has been taking good care of us during our 3 nights stay. She gave us a tour around her house on the first night we arrived. She gave us some guidance on how to go to the places that we wanted to visit. In addition she prepared us food and drinks as well. Mario on the other hand has given us a very detailed check in guidance few days before our arrival so we had a very smooth check in.

Secondly the room and toilet are very stylish and amenities are very complete.  Whatever we need are provided. The place is very clean as well.

Thirdly, it is quite convenient and safe. It is just 3 minutes walk to the train station and is quite convenient to most tourist attractions. Also, it is just 1 min walk to convenient mart. And most importantly i feel quite safe to stay in there as it is abit away from city so security wise is very good and surroundings are very quiet. 

The place is far above our expectations. I definitely recommend this place to people who visit Rome."

31464,540925986,2019-10-04,84243935,Martin,It was a good place to stay in Rome. We were there 3 nights and all was perfect. The apartment is soo close to the metro station and was soo easy to find it. There is private bathroom in our room but is like little acuarium and everything is view inside. For us was fine but for new couples maybe will be not cool. Thanks for all!

31464,554355235,2019-10-26,103079718,Anna,"The apartment is very beautiful and stylish, and Mario with his wife are friendly and helpful,  yet it`s difficult to feel at home there.  

The rule that it`s prohibited to use shower after 23:00 is not comfortable at all. The private bathroom\toilet is  with a transparent glass door. And though it is said that you can`t see a person inside the bathroom, it is clearly not true. 

Also it`s quite funny that the announcement says  warm apartment with a Hi-fi stereo but the house rules that are handed to the guests actually say that the stereo is not available for us. When we asked if we can use it, Mario promised to show how to do it when he`s at home but in the end we didn`t have a chance to do it. It`s not a big problem, but that stereo is a thing that is highlighted in the title."

We were late arriving and were greeted by Marioâs wife who was very helpful, showing us where everything was in the kitchen, we had a shelf in the fridge and they included a welcome bottle of wine, milk, yoghurt, eggs, fruit and biscuits which was really nice. She also showed us where the important Metro Stations were for all of the tourist attractions.

The bedroom was nice and the bed really comfy, the en-suite bathroom was small but adequate with a nice shower. We werenât too keen that there was only a glass sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which may not suit everyone 

Positive points - comfy bed, near to the Metro, nice patisserie just over the road, free car park nearby

Negative points - Quite a small bed and en-suite"

There was a pretty decorated room with beds with clean and fresh bedlinen and towels. We had the use of a private bathroom, which was spic and span. The Metrostation Bologna is a five-minutes walk away and the bus stop into the historic center is in front of the appartmentbuilding.
The only negative point is that the Via Catania is a very busy road with a lot of noisy traffic. So when you bring your earplugs you will have a convenient stay in Rome thanks to Micaela and her family! "

Breakfast was served in our room every morning at the time we chose.  The room was very comfortable and represented well in the photos.  We were there during a heatwave and the a/c in the large room was barely sufficient to cool the entire room, but once we changed to a smaller room, the a/c was just fine.  The bathrooms were recently remodeled and my only complaint was that I was never able to regulate the shower temperature correctly.  It was either hot or cold!  This was not a reflection of the owners, but just the design of the faucets.  The neighborhood was a nice discovery.  There were no tourists around and we enjoyed checking out the local establishments where the locals were dining, shopping, and living.  We will miss our hosts and hope to be back again very soon!  "

Very clean and updated.  We were about an hour late to meet Lorenzo when we first arrived (just a little detour...) but he stuck around to give us the key.  He was very professional and happy to help out.  One thing is the apartment does not have WiFi, but we found a bar that had it available nearby which worked great for us.  I would stay there again for sure."

You also have businesses next to to him (tobacco for purchases of subway tickets and drunk, sandwiches, ...).
It's situated in the historic center and the building is typical buildings of the South with a court in internal.
The housing is clean and practical and you have all the necessities for your breakfasts.
It is well advisable for a couple.
And charming surprise upon our arrival for the New Year, he offered us a bottle of Italian sparkling white wine!

There is everything for cooking and for pleasant evening with glass of wine.
We found all things we need for shower (clean towels, shampoo, soap). And very important fo me - there was no any problems with hot water!
There was pleasant surprise for us â good WiFi.
Maybe only one thing could be worry â it not so easy to find flat without map in first time.

We knew it would be central but we didn't realise that the Colosseum would be literally a 5 minute walk away. We didn't need to get public transport at all, everything is within walking distance, including the Vatican - less than a half an hour walk - and Roma Termini. I would definitely recommend Anna Home for a city break in Rome and we will definitely be back!"
37054,233725,2011-04-21,205550,Alberto,"Great stay!

Anna home is located in a very quiet street and, really convenient for visiting Rome. Everything inside the apartment works great (tv, wifi, hot water).

Lorenzo left breakfast for us and small bottles of water that were really appreciated!

The apartment is very small but really comfy."
37054,249320,2011-05-03,337415,Gianfranco,"Lorenzo ci ha dato il benvenuto a Roma e ci ha mostrato l'appartamento prima di consegnarci le chiavi. L'appartamento ha tutti i confort necessari per una permanenza a Roma. Trovare dell'acqua, succo e latte in frigorifero Ã© veramente gentile. Noi ci siamo trovati benissimo e tornerei volentieri."
37054,260979,2011-05-12,539851,Alejandra,"everything was perfect! the apartment is really beautiful and very clean, and so well located.Lorenzo is a great person,he received us very well and gave us all the information that we need. He  left us everything for breakfast, marmalade, toast, coffee illy , tea ,and  milk and also bottles of water.
I definitely recommend it!! I hope to return soon.
"
37054,270467,2011-05-19,440553,Mandy,"This apartment, though small, was exquisitely clean and the simple decor was easy on the eyes after hard days of sightseeing. Nice building with good security and adorable inner courtyard.  Lorenzo provided all the amenities including breakfast foods and beverages, towels and shampoo.  Best coffee we had anywhere in Europe. Treated like a true B&B, except no old ladies breathing down your neck! Great value for the price!"
37054,277065,2011-05-23,130740,Erica,"I really enjoyed my stay in this apartment. The location was perfect, near so many beautiful sights but on a quiet, charming backstreet. The apartment was clean, simply decorated, and stocked with coffee, pastries, jams, tea, and water. The building is secure and recently renovated. Lorenzo and Anna were very welcoming and helpful, and really cared about making my stay enjoyable. When I return to Rome, I will stay here again!"
37054,280888,2011-05-25,350745,Shannon,"Anna Home was in the perfect location! So close to all of the major sites. The Roman Forum just around the corner, the Coloseum about 5-10 minutes walking distance. The apartment was spotless and exactly what we needed. Lorenzo was even kind enough to stock the fridge with some bottled waters and left little delicious candies out for us. We would definitely stay there again!"
37054,292500,2011-06-01,430828,Seng,"Lorenzo's place was perfect for our stay in Rome.  The shower was larger than the usual European size.  The apt faced the courtyard and never had direct sunlight; therefore, we were able to keep the window open to cool down the apt during the 85+ degree weather. Lorenzo thought of everything.  He included yummy breakfast food and bottled water.  The Wi-Fi was an unexpected surprise.  Anna house is in a prime,quiet location.  We would definitely stay here again!  Thanks Lorenzo!"
37054,297954,2011-06-05,460839,Marco,"Anna's home has a very good location. The apartment is clean and usually quiet. The bed isn't very comfortable (it's a pull-out sofa) but in the overall i recommend the apartment for anyone who wants to visit Rome.
Lorenzo gave us all the information we need."
37054,304869,2011-06-09,203175,Paul,"Lorenzo was able to meet us even though we got into Rome a bit earlier than expected. Nice apartment in a great location. Lots of Rome-related material to read. Some food and drinks were in the kitchen area, which was nice."
37054,308391,2011-06-11,621914,Antonio,"Hemos estado dos dÃ­as en en la casa Anna home, la estancia ha sido muy buena, es muy pequeÃ±a pero a cambio lo tiene todo bien, la zona es bastante buena pues en 10 minutos estas en el centro de Roma. Todo Ok con Lorenzo. Recomiendo 100% Anna home."
37054,361651,2011-07-09,353130,James,"We had a great time staying at Lorenzoâs apartment in Rome. The apartment was very clean, comfortable and in a great location. It was very close to everything you could need, such as restaurants and barely a 10 minute walk from the Coliseum which was great. We were greeted at the apartment by Lorenzo's friend Anna, and the day we left Lorenzo met us and arranged a taxi for us to the train station. Lorenzo even took care to have bottled water in the fridge, snacks in the cupboard, maps of the area and he gladly gave us recommendations about restaurants to eat at. 

Our stay was very pleasant and weâd highly recommend Lorenzoâs apartment!"
37054,371742,2011-07-14,353951,Fernando,"Anna Home was the perfect place for our stay in Rome. The place is wonderful!!! Lorenzo is a fantastict host. He is really helpful. We forgot a wallet when we left and he immedaitelly contacted us to see how he could return it. He went to all the trouble to find how to send it to our next destination. We couldn't have been better hosted!!! Thank you so much Lorenzo, hope to be in Anna Home again!!!"
37054,382382,2011-07-19,463924,Mei,"Anna home is perfect location for visitors to Rome, with the Colosseum only 5mins away!
Lorenzo was easy to get in touch with and very helpful with any questions we had and helped us book a taxi on the day we left.
We also discovered the restaurant right outside the apartment ""Marios"" was very well priced for very good food, highly recommended!
We would definitely come back to stay if we every come to Rome."
37054,397477,2011-07-26,271733,Lauren,"Lorenzo's apartment was the perfect location for our first stay in Rome. The apartment is central and walking distance to nearly all sites. It has all the amenities you need for a week visit. Lorenzo also provided croissants, jam, coffee, milk, and juices which was perfect for breakfast. 

I highly recommend Lorenzo and his apartment!"
37054,408052,2011-07-31,543592,Richard,"Lorenzo's place is okay for short stay. It's very small, and there were things that were falling apart a little. The bathroom is particularly crowded. It's quite central but still removed from the main tourist areas, and we found it hard to move around with Rome's public transport. Suggest to hire a car or scooter next time. There are some nice local bars and restaraunts around which are away from the tourists, and some of the historical sites are just a short walk away. Lorenzo was a great host, and welcomed us when we arrived, the place was very clean."
37054,424218,2011-08-06,563657,Sarah & Richard,"We had a great stay at Lorenzos place. It's small, but great for exploring Rome, very very close to the collaseum. The only downside is we couldn't check in until the afternoon as our train arrived after the check in time, so had to store our luggage at the train station. But would definitely stay again."
37054,431429,2011-08-09,264120,Taco,"Ideal place for two people in Rome for a couple of days. Comfortable and complete; nice, central location in a beautiful building. Wonderful details like mini shampoo bottles and a stocked fridge. Clean, air-conditioned. Recommended!"
37054,499191,2011-09-04,429618,Camille,"Great holidays at Anna's  Home! in the center of Rome it's the perfect place to go if you want to visit the Italian capital during a weekend or a week.
Thank you for this week."
37054,516743,2011-09-09,1103746,Caroline,"I am just so glad I booked at Anna Home while I was in Rome. The apartment was perfect for me, very quiet, very clean and close to almost all the places I wanted to see. Lorenzo is a fabulous host. He had milk, juice, coffee and some pastries for breakfast. He answered all my questions and even helped me with cords to charge my phone. Thank you Lorenzo!!!"
37054,526872,2011-09-13,89990,ClÃ©ment,Great location and nice host. Recommended!
37054,533530,2011-09-15,933692,Abdur-Rahim,"A very well-welcoming host regardless we checked-in quite late at night. Great location (short walking distance from Colloseum, Roman Forum, Palatine), cozy, well-equipped and friendly host! Highly recommended!!"
37054,541277,2011-09-18,517170,Izzy,"located just 5mins walk from Colosseum, it is a perfect starting point to get around Rome. We were there for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay there. Lorenzo's friend received us on the first day,.. As our airport shuttle was running late, his friend was very kind to be waiting for us. He showed us to the apartment and gave us directions. the unit is just 1 floor up and there is a lift if you need. The closest metro cavour is only 3 mins walk away... easy to get to and from airport. the cobble stone streets - which is everywhere in rome ; may be hard to use your trolley bag to get to metro. 

The unit is compact with a small kitchenette with a tiny mini fridge with drinks stocked up. the sofa bed was comfortable with a good bathroom with everything you need. The free Wifi and AC are very handy. 

very reasonable price for the unit in a very safe apartment and neighbourhood with good restaurants near the fountain. highly recommended! 

Rome is easy to get around by foot. We did not use any metro/ bus when we were there, a trip to vatican city is a must!  "
37054,553487,2011-09-21,869844,Tracy,"Clean cute secure studio in an excellent central location.  We really enjoyed our stay.  Great restaurant options, groceries within a short (3 minute) walk.  

Our train came in late at night and was delayed.  Lorenzo was easy to get in touch with by text and arranged for his friend to let us in despite the fact that our train was an hour late.  No glitches.  We were able to walk to the studio from the station (15 minutes). 

Good price for the location.  Bed is an IKEA futon - not the most comfortable but we slept just fine.  

Would highly recommend - we would stay here again if we came back to Rome! "
37054,578189,2011-09-28,846020,Amber,"My husband and I LOVED our stay at Anna home! Such a great location! It is located ""off the beaten path"" on a cute little street. It's an easy bus ride from the train station. The 40 or 64 bus will take you to the main street near the studio. Although most sights are within walking distance from the studio, the 40 or 64 bus will get you all over town very cheaply. There are tons of dining options, shopping, and historical sites just a few blocks away from Anna home. The studio itself felt like a mini hotel. Everything was so clean and we really loved the added touch with the provided breakfast items, bottled water, towels, and toiletries. The air conditioning very worked well. Lorenzo was a great host. He supplied us with maps, information, and dining suggestions. We would highly recommend the Anna home for a wonderful stay while visiting Rome. "
37054,588235,2011-10-02,184981,Beth,"we LOVED anna home! it is small but it was perfect for the two of us (couple). we walked everywhere in rome from lorenzos. the street the apt is on is so pretty, its sort of tucked away. very quiet, even though youre right in the middle of the action. the futon was super comfortable, the apt was sooo clean, the air conditioning was great, kept us nice and cool, and the wifi was very fast. the bathroom is so cute and clean, with shampoo and soap and lots of clean towels. the kitchen is tiny but so cute. we cooked a few meals in there. lorenzo left us breakfast food, milk and juice and bottled water, which was wonderful! and there are great little clothing and other shops right in the neighborhood! we loved our experience!!! we loved rome!!! thank you, lorenzo! ciao! "
37054,630554,2011-10-16,990458,Samantha,"Location is everything. Walking distance to many sites or just a metro/bus ride away. Enough room for two. We enjoyed walking to the Colosseum at night and listening to the street performer play music. Convenient small businesses and restaurants close buy.

Lorenzo was a great host. We requested some extra blankets and he got them to us the same day."
37054,644411,2011-10-19,69604,Cyril,"The appartment is very nice and is in a very good position, near Colosseo, Forum and Palatin.
Lorenzo is a great host and we recommend his appartment to all of the airbnb travellers.
We are sure of choosing again his accomodation if we come back to Rome."
37054,661906,2011-10-25,750755,PatrÃ­cia,"Anna's Home was the perfect place to stay at while in Rome. Right in the center, we could walk anywhere, we barely used th metro or any other transportation. The colosseo was only a 7 minute walk away, so we got to see it every day or every night - which was our favourite. The area felt safe and we could buy and cook our own food whenever we felt like it. 
There was already some water in the fridge and some beverages and food for breakfast, which was very thoughtful.
I do recommend Anna's Home to everyone! Enjoy Rome."
37054,691018,2011-11-04,375367,Muriel,"I've stayed at Anna's Home 4 nights and loved it! The location is just perfect, as said before.  It's a tiny apartment but very well equipped and sufficient for two.  it was also very useful to have the wi-fi.
Lorenzo is a very nice host, and left a little breakfast hamper (sweet buns,  tea, coffee, sugar, milk, fruit juice, water bottle): thank you for our stay,
I've already recommend Anna's Home to all of my friends !!"
37054,715500,2011-11-14,848203,Nick,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Lorenzo's house in Rome for 4 nights. We loved Rome and Anna home was perfect for it. Great location, beautiful street and building and the apartment had everything we needed. Very clean functional, would recommend it. "
37054,727382,2011-11-18,179323,Alessandro Guido,"We enjoyed very much to stay at anna's home. The location is perfect! The most famous places can be visited by feet. The apartament is small but very cozy for a couple and on a short stay. Is there a close neighborhood called Monti, where you find a lot of restaurants, stores, etc... Out of the tourist circuit...
Lorenzo was very helpful and nice. We recommend Anna's Home!!"
37054,737460,2011-11-22,1287434,Elizabeth,great location - near all the sights.  lorenzo was waiting for us when we arrived - he was very helpful.  there was water in the fridge for us - he helped identify some places to go.  the apartment itself was perfect.  it was clean and modern - the bathroom was nice and the bed was comfortable.  this is a great place to stay for your visit to rome
37054,743620,2011-11-25,1273514,David,"Very nice apartment, helpful host and perfect location, I highly recommend it. "
37054,760259,2011-12-03,851831,Andrew & Robyn,"overall, this apartment is very good value for rome and ideal for a one to three night stay for one person or a couple. (it is very tiny! but comfortable)

it was very clean, had plenty of fresh towels and small details had been looked after such as new bottles of water in the fridge and shampoo/body wash in the shower. 

the location was excellent. 

unfortunately, the greeter who let us into the flat was twenty minutes late."
37054,767464,2011-12-06,711609,Steve,"I had a wonderful stay at Anna Home. Lorenzo was very helpful and the check-in was very easy. The flat was very clean, white, nicely decorated, with air conditioning and heater, free WIFI access, and I really appreciated all the little extras Lorenzo provided like shampoo, soap, coffee and some little things to eat in the morning. The location of the flat is in the old part of Rome, SUPER centrally located and very easy to get to the coliseum, and many other sites. Its in a very safe, and quiet street, so no problems with personal security. The metro line to connect anywhere in Rome is only 5 minutes away. Overall, a very pleasant experience. The next time I come to Rome, I will definitely stay at Anna Home. 5 stars all the way. Thanks"
37054,778922,2011-12-12,697408,Thijs,Great small apartment in a wonderful location. We had a very good experience staying here for a few days.
37054,801493,2011-12-23,1259124,Shanna,Great place. Quite small but has everything you need. Perfect size for a couple. Also has a very great location near the Colosseum and Roman Forum. 
37054,865538,2012-01-16,1535046,Timothy,"Terrific place in the most convenient location imaginable in Rome. Monti is a great neighborhood, and you are walking distance to everything. Lorenzo is a fantastic host! "
37054,891074,2012-01-30,742756,Shai,"Had a great time. The apartment is small but comfortable, clean and had all we needed in a really great location. Thank you Lorenzo!"
37054,904390,2012-02-06,1590211,Andrea,Very pretty appartement in a beautiful renovated building in the optimal location. 100% privacy and comfort  and a really nice and reliable host - Lorenzo. If I'll ever be in Rome again I will definitely choose again Anna's home!
37054,959234,2012-02-28,1629508,Nadja,"We stayed at Ann Home for a total of 4 nights. The biggest asset of the appertment is, besides Lorenzo's hospatility, the awsome location the flat is set in. You literally step out of the door and already can see parts of the Foro Romano. It's just a few steps, not a minute walk, until you are on the Via Fiori Imperali, the Collosseum to your left, the Foro Romano in front of you and the Via Piazza to your right. It's the perfect location to start any trip in Rome and to explore the city.
Leaving the appartment towards the other direction, you sometime cross Via dei Serpentini, which offered us the best Ristorante (Il Colonne) and a great Gelateria close by. 
The flat is in the middle of Rome, but it is very quite though. It's really been perfect for us.
The appartment is tiny, but we knew this before, since we read all information. But it perfectly serves it's purpose! We had everything we needed, and Lorenzo took care by filling the fridge with some water, milk and juice, providing coffe, tea and some small crackers. For 3 nights it was just the perfect place to be. I think, If you are 2 persons and stay longer than 4 nights, it might be a little too small, but I think even that could be handled. All thumbs up for Lorenzo & Anna Home!"
37054,990795,2012-03-12,736029,Christian,"After checking a few reviews for our trip to Rome I picked Lorenzos apartment for our weekend stay. These reviews said ""nice and friendly host"", ""clean apartment, small but just fine"", ""great location, close to everything you need"".
And they were all right. We got a warm welcome, fell out of our apartment and into nice (not so touristic) restaurants and other hot spots, could almost smell the sweat of the roman looking guys who offer taking a photo with them in front of the Colosseum and had enough clean and tidy room for 2 for 2 nights in bella Italia.

Thx from Germany!"
37054,1006718,2012-03-17,1670891,Santkovsky,"La experiencia fue la mejor posible , esta muy bien amueblado el departamento , con lo necesario para estar en Roma , todo esta cuidado al detalle y l,a ubicacion es perfecta por su cercania al Coliseo , a la Fontana de Trevi , a la Plaza Venecia , el Foro de Trajano, etc
Las pocas veces que necesitamos ayuda de Leonardo estuvo siempre atento y disponible . Por ejemplo el avion perdio mi valija , se comunicaron el y se ocupo de abrir a la compaÃ±ia aerea para que la traigan.
Es un departamento ideal para una pareja que tenga  el deseo de conocer Roma
Imposible tener problemas en Ana House .

37054,1026618,2012-03-21,647989,David,"Just as we expected. Very cute apartment in a great location. Small but very convenient.
Perfect for a long week end in Rome.
I highly recommend it!!

Cheers,

37054,1108205,2012-04-11,1582192,Quentin,"Laurenzio was really flexible upon arrival and met us in front of the appartment at half pas midnight on a friday evening to give us the keys.

The apartment was very clean with towels and be linens available, some bottels of water in the fridge and coffee for our first breakfast.

The apartment is very close (5min walk from the Forum and the Capitole)

only point is that we were supposed to be flexible for our departure time but we finallay had to leave around 12 on the sunday, leaving us no choice but to go the train station to drop our luggage for the afternoon (we lost 1 hour so no big deal).

"
37054,1126515,2012-04-14,508018,Daniel,"Me and my wife stayed in Rome for 3 nights and found the apartment to be an excellent choice. It is extremely well located and for a small apartment, had all of the amenities we needed for a short stay. Although we didn't have the pleasure of meeting Lorenzo personally, he made sure we were taken care of. We were met by Anna for a late check-in. Lorenzo kept in touch with us during our stay to make sure we were having a good time and offering any assistance. Highly recommended!"
37054,1141833,2012-04-17,1517076,Fred,"Our stay at Anna Home was wonderful due to the terrific location, extreme cleanliness and generous assistance of Lorenzo.  We can't imagine a better spot from which to tour ancient Rome--we were a stone's throw away from the Forum--but well tucked away from the street noise so our sleep was restful.   The ""hip and happening"" night life is just a few minutes stroll away.  Though quite small, the efficient lay out of the room and location more than compensated for the size.  Very comfortable bed, clean and modern bath.  Lorenzo lives nearby and is readily available by phone/e-mail and was willing to assist with special needs.  The apartment was stocked up with tourist info and welcome treats.  We love this place."
37054,1176398,2012-04-25,1133573,David,"Great place! Very quiet, very clean, milk, juice, melba toast, etc supplied. Lorenzo was very helpful, reiiable, responsed quickly to all emails.  So central, we could walk most places. In a quiet street with no traffic. Gets tops recommendation."
37054,1195127,2012-04-29,1667794,Gokhan,Ä°t was our first airbnb experience and absolutely a right choice.Lorenzo's apartment is in a perfect location.We walked everywhere easily.And kindly he waited for us about half an hour at the door and left us something for breakfast.We recommend it to all.
37054,1207612,2012-05-01,1763447,Diana,"Cute little apartment - close to the Colosseum, Imperial forum, Roman forum and the list goes on! Highly recommend for a stay. "
37054,1228602,2012-05-05,1517076,Fred,"Terrific location, nice cosy flat, wonderful host.  Our second stay at Anna Home, please see our previous review."
37054,1251613,2012-05-09,241455,Bertrand,We spent a wonderful trip in Roma. Thanks to Lorenzo and his help. The place is perfectly located and just like we expected : in a small and typical Roma street. 
37054,1269728,2012-05-13,1607339,John,"The apartment is located on a quiet little street off the Salita del Grillo, a small, sloping street in the ancient heart of Rome that descends behind imposing ancient, medieval and Renaissance structures.  The unit is located one floor up in a very well-maintained building and has windows facing a lovely interior courtyard that lets in natural light.  We are a couple, stayed three nights, and it worked perfectly for us as a convenient starting point for exploring the city.  Lorenzo is so very friendly and welcoming.  It was a pleasure to meet him. "
37054,1292971,2012-05-17,1465795,Alan,"Anna Home was just perfect for us. Although small, it was comfortable, clean, and quiet. The location couldn't be betterâright on the edge of the Monti neighborhood with great restaurants, shops, and galleries. We enjoyed many gelati in Piazza Madonna de Monti. Fifty feet from the front door are the ancient ruins of Traino's Market, and the Colosseum and Forum are a 5 minute walk. From Anna Home, modern and ancient Rome are literaly at your feet! Lorenzo is a kind and generous host."
37054,1380815,2012-05-30,593497,Andreis,"AMAZING! i loved it a lot! Guys this is a place where to go if you want to woke up in the heart of Rome.

"
37054,1404078,2012-06-03,1978521,Becca,"Lorenzo is a wonderful host! He communicated very quickly and was waiting for us when we arrived. The place is a little tricky to find but once we got there we loved it. The neighborhood is great and very interesting. Lorenzo can help with recommendations but just walking anywhere from the apartment is wonderful. The place is tiny but vey clean, we would definitely stay again!"
37054,1479758,2012-06-14,1699996,Martin,"We loved staying in the Anna Home.  It was a very convenient place to stay and we walked to many of Rome's best attractions.  The apartment is a convenient 10 minute walk to the Colosseum and isn't far from the train station.  

Anna Home has a kitchen, so we had a fun time walking to the market and cooking dinner.  We were so tired after walking all over Rome and we didn't mind the futon.  It was very comfortable.  The air conditioning was the best part because Rome gets very hot.  

Make sure that you set up an exact time to meet up with Lorenzo, the owner of Anna Home.  We didn't, but luckily there was an internet cafe nearby, so we emailed him and he came right away.  "
37054,1533465,2012-06-22,1573275,Laura,We are a couple who stayed here for 5 nights in June. Our stay here was great! such a convenient location with nice restaurants & shops near by as well as sights such as Colosseum and the forum just a few minutes from the apartment. The apartment was very clean and we were very generously left coffee and something for breakfast which was a lovely surprise. There is also tourist information such as maps a guide book and flyers of things to do in Rome. We would definitely recommend Anna Home. 
37054,1586736,2012-06-29,2059159,Nick,We only stayed in Rome 2 nights but this place was absolutely perfect. Right around the corner from the Coloseum and Roman Forum as well as walking distance to a number of other sights. It was very hot while we were there and very much appreciated the air conditioning too! Great place
37054,1640054,2012-07-06,1996135,Aleksandar,"Our first Airbnb experience. We stayed at Anna's Home 7 nights. The appartment was just as we expected. Nice, clean, functional and located in an awsome location. Close to Colosseum, Roman Forum, ... We were met by Anna for a late check-in. Lorenzo is a fantastic host, he communicated very fast, giving all needed details. 

I do recommend Anna's Home to everyone!"
37054,1673344,2012-07-10,1700824,Kathryn,"Absolutely fantastic place for a couple to explore the city! We were steps from the Roman Forum and 3 blocks from the Colosseum! Transit was easily accessible and we used it often to explore other parts of Rome. The place itself was modern, clean and had absolutely everything you could need. The AC was such a plus since it was 95 degrees everyday.

Communication with the host was impeccable and we really appreciated it because we had some traveling hang ups. Overall, if you are single or a couple this is the ideal place to explore Rome."

Lorenzo was very friendly and helpful! We would definitely stay here again."
37054,1759943,2012-07-21,1570801,Ramiro,"The place is located steps away from the Forum, the Coliseum, Altare della Patria (a.k.a wedding cake). It has air conditioning, a kitchen, and everything you need for a nice stay! I loved staying here and would gladly stay here again. Thanks Anna and Lorenzo!"
37054,1827631,2012-07-29,2528617,Rob,"Everything was as advertised. Excellent location in the heart of the city, walking distance to many of the popular sites. Very clean and efficient apartment, and Lorenzo is welcoming and organized. We recommend Anna Home."

37054,2008878,2012-08-17,2220903,Eddie,"Fantastic apartment in a fantastic area.  Right across from the Roman Forum and down the street from the Colosseum on a very quiet old street.  You can easily walk to other places like the Pantheon and Campo de' Fiori which has some excellent restaurants, though there are some nice little places to eat nearby and some cool little bars.  The apartment is small but perfect for 2 people and even has an elevator right outside the door if you have heavy luggage.  We really enjoyed our time here and would love to stay here again when we return to Rome."
37054,2280173,2012-09-14,3209201,Telmo,"Very nice flat in the very center of Rome.  All important places to see are at a short walking distance.  The apartment  belongs to a classical house in the historical center that has been well retrofitted with elevator, security locks, painting, etc., while keeping the romantic environment of an old building.  The flat is rather tiny, altough it features most of the things you may need (INCLUDING air conditioning !!) optimizing te space available like in a sayling boat.  Lorenzo is very responsive and provides prompt and clear indications to faciltate your living."
37054,2330632,2012-09-18,1636621,Juan,"Great apartment, well maintained by a wonderful host. Lorenzo was extremely prompt in communicating with us and answered all our questions. The apartment is is a very good location and its very easy to get around and be independent. We'd highly recommend!"
37054,2417204,2012-09-26,2105300,Jaehee,"Nice apartment in great location near forum and colosseum. 
It was good size for myself and my husband. 
Lorenzo is a very nice host and very helpful. 
He gave us very good information about Rome and restaurant he recommended was great and close to apartment. 
Communication was excellent.
Area where the apartment is located in is very safe all day and even late at night. 
"
37054,2493257,2012-10-03,2562181,Nathaniel,"We stayed in the apartment for 5 nights while in Rome.  The apartment is very small, but nice.  It consists of one general purpose room with a kitchen corner, dining table, & futon, and a bathroom.  The futon was relatively comfortable, and neither of us had any issues sleeping on it.  The kitchen also seemed like it would get the job done, although we used it very little.  It did have a mini-fridge which was nice, and we used that to keep some meat and cheese that we bought at a market around the corner.  

The location was great - it was less than a 10 min walk to the Colosseum, Forum, and Palatine Hill.  The taxi to Vatican City was only about 10 euros.  The nearest main street is Via Cavour, which is full of souvenir shops, restaurants, markets, etc.  We had everything we needed in close walking distance.  

On our first day, a computer malfunction caused a booking hiccup, but Lorenzo put us up in a great hotel just around the corner that first night without us having to ask or anything, and was great about being accommodating when our plans changed the next day and we had to move our things from the hotel to the apartment earlier than planned.

Lorenzo was a great host, and the apartment was everything we needed at a great price in a great location.  5 stars!"
37054,2555647,2012-10-09,2173703,Mariah,"Wonderful location and cozy intimate apartment.
The BEST wifi we had for three weeks in Europe.
It's nice that he had tea and bisquits for the mornings.
Lorenzo was a dear to talk with.  "

37054,2759044,2012-10-30,3306235,JosÃ© Luiz E Manuella,O local tem uma localizaÃ§Ã£o excelente! O apartamento Ã© pequeno mas ideal para um casal de turistas que sÃ³ precisa de um quarto limpo e confortÃ¡vel para descansar. Lorenzo foi muito atencioso e compreensivo com nosso atraso devido Ã  conexÃ£o no aeroporto. Recomendamos muito pelos maravilhosos dias que passamos em Roma.
37054,2824344,2012-11-07,3538663,Marie,"Lorenzo was a wonderful host. He waited for us patiently despite we were late. He gave us all  informations we needed.
His appartement is small but very cosy, clean, and has everything you need to have a nice stay. The building (very clean too) is located in a quiet street, in a secure and cool neighbourhood.
Cherry on the cake, the appartment is perfectly located. So you can do almost everything on foot and if you want to go to the Vatican city for instance, you can easily take a bus.
We stayed  only 4 nigths but if it was possible, we would have stayed all  week long.  
If we go back to Roma, we surely book Anna home again."
37054,2874780,2012-11-13,1035009,Nassim,"Lorenzo was the perfect host and Anaâs place lives up to its reputation. the place was cosy, clean, confortable, perfect for a short break in Rome.
itâs located 10 mn walk from most of the sites and of the city.

37054,3019335,2012-12-03,1377599,Sara,"Abbiamo soggiornato 3 notti da Anna home al foro Romano.
Monolocale molto carino nel cuore di Roma. La posizione Ã¨ perfetta per muoversi a piedi e raggiungere in poco tempo tutte le attrazioni principali della cittÃ ; il quartiere Monti, dove si trova l'appartamento, Ã¨ una bellissima zona da vivere.
Lorenzo Ã¨ stato molto disponibile e preciso in tutto. 
Il monolocale Ã¨ essenziale ma ha tutto quello che serve per un piacevole soggiorno.

Consigliato a tutti!!


We stayed 3 nights at the home of Anna Roman Forum.
Very nice studio in the heart of Rome. The location is perfect to walk around and easily reach all the main attractions of the city, the Monti district, where the apartment is located, is a beautiful area to live.
Lorenzo was very helpful and considerate throughout.
The apartment is basic but has everything you need for a pleasant stay.
Coffee, tea, juice and everything you need for breakfast.
Recommended to all!"
37054,3152862,2012-12-25,3887357,Fahmi,"Wonderful location. It is really quiet, and a stone throw away from great sights (i.e. The Roman Forum, and etc.). Lorenzo was accommodating, as he waited for us to check in pretty late. He even allowed us to leave our luggage at the place, and check out later than usual. Great host, great place! "
37054,3261204,2013-01-04,3779107,Alexandra,"We had a very nice stay at Anna Home. The apartment is ideally located, 5 mn away from the Coliseum and 10mn from the historical center. The metro station is also about 10mn. The flat was very clean, with tea and coffee available for breakfast, and maps of Rome and even a guide book. Just be aware that the ceiling of the bathroom is quite low and would bother you if you are more than 1,8m high.
Lorenzo was really nice and always ready to help. He answered our messages quickly and was flexible on the check in and check out times. All in all a very pleasant stay!"
37054,3314499,2013-01-09,3698187,Alli,"We had a fantastic time staying at Lorenzo's apartment. There was some trouble in finding it, but Lorenzo had two very kind friends come to help us which was invaluable. It's a great location within walking distance of sights such as the Colosseum and the Roman Forum, as well as two handy Metro stops. We would definitely recommend this apartment to other travellers to Roma!"
37054,3342612,2013-01-14,3734408,JunJie,"The location is very good, 5 min walk to Colosseo and Ancient Roman Forum. The apartment is very small but OK for a couple. The bed is a sofa bed and comfortable. The kitchen is tiny and well-equip. There was no mechanical ventilation in the room. One night, we opened the window during our cooking but a lady came to the window and yelled in Italian, which we didn't understand and she really scared us the whole night. Next day Lorenzo sent us email and told us close the window. We didn't meet Lorenzo, his friend welcome us in the apartment. During our stay, we asked Lorenzo for advice and his response is quick and helpful. We stayed for 5 days in Lorenzo's place and overall we like this place. "
37054,3367126,2013-01-18,4463791,Sarah,"The studio was cozy and perfectly clean. It was an appropriate size for a couple and a great place to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. The location was great! Right in the heart of ancient Rome, a few blocks from the Colosseum and a block away from the Forum. The area features many restaurants, markets, and other shops. The host Steve is very nice, very approachable, and super helpful. The neighborhood seemed touristy only during the day, but at night it seemed like a hip area where young romans came to have dinner and hang out. I highly recommend this place for its cleanliness and location."
37054,3414749,2013-01-26,2529321,Genevieve,"We had a great time in Rome and Lorenzo's apartment is in a fantastic position to enjoy it. Only a few minutes walk from the Colosseum and Metro, and the Roman Forum is right at the end of the street!  Lots of great little restaurants and bars nearby - perfect position.  The apartment was clean and Lorenzo was very helpful, the only issue we had was that the apartment is a little small, but that didn't really matter as we were out most of the time.  The bed is very comfortable, but the ceiling in the shower is a little low - my partner is 6'3 and couldn't stand up straight and the water pressure wasn't great.  These were only minor things and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Lorenzo's apartment for anybody coming to Rome!  Thank you :)"
37054,3428396,2013-01-28,4620386,Matthieu,"Thank you Lorenzo for your warm welcome. Your appartment is very nice, very clean and ideally placed close to the colliseum. We hope we can come back and visit more."
37054,3451944,2013-02-01,4219984,Connie,"Thank you Lorenzo for a wonderful few days in Rome! We arrived in Rome with some taxi drama after setting foot in a taxi scam car at Termini Station. Note: make sure your taxi driver turns on the meter and didn't ""forget"" to turn it on + make sure they are not charging you an inflated fixed fee. We could not speak much Italian so we messaged Lorenzo who was so kind to come meet us out on the street to speak to the driver on behalf of us.

On our way to the airport, he also kindly helped us book a private car transfer, which proved to be very reliable and more affordable than a taxi.

The apartment itself is in a great, secure location. There is a lift to reach the 1st floor & everything inside is very new and clean. There was also food for breakfast as well & wifi too. Only thing to note if you stay here is that the shower knob is labeled the wrong way. Red is cold, blue is hot! 

Thank you Lorenzo!

Connie & Tom"
37054,3536646,2013-02-13,1614950,Nicolas,Functional and nicely located flat. Lorenzo wal also really helpful. Definitely worth the price.
37054,3570707,2013-02-18,4835538,Rutie,"we stayed at Lorenzo appartment for 5 nights and had a great time.
the location is perfect, in a quite street in the lovely Monti neighberhood, a walking distance from all the places you wan't to visit. 
Lorenzo was kind and helpful,
we highly recomand the appatment.
"
37054,3623637,2013-02-26,300148,Andy,"Anna's House is just as it appears, ideal value in a great location, it is small though but for two intimate travellers thats fine. Host Lorenzo is very kind and reliable with information before and during stay. Would recommend the appartment without hesitation if  you want to be on doorstep of ancient sites in a nice, youthful neighbourhood."
37054,3686405,2013-03-04,4937063,Naouel,"Lorenzo welcomed us at the flat after our taxi ride from the airport. He was really friendly and answered the questions we had about Rome, as well as giving us useful advice about what he thought we should do/visit even though it was late in the evening. 

The flat was lovely and clean, and its location was absolutely perfect to enjoy the city. Lorenzo had provided city guides and the fridge was full with water, juice and milk for breakfast.

Finally, although we were meant to checkout at 10am on our last day, Lorenzo let us enjoy access to the flat until mid-afternoon as he didn't have any booking for that day. This allowed us to make the most of our last day before leaving for the airport without having to carry out suitcase around Rome.

All in all a brilliant stay - I'd recommend Anna Home to anyone wanting to spend a weekend in Rome."
37054,3734018,2013-03-09,1604096,Elisabeth,Lorenzo is a very friendly host with a great studio in Ancient Rome! We were able to walk to the Colosseum in minutes and saw all of Rome's major attractions on foot. 
37054,3773572,2013-03-13,5017208,Nicolas,"It was perfect! The flat is exactly as described, very clean with a lot of things to eat in the morning, coffee... The flat is really close to the town center, at 100m of Mercadi di Traiano.

Lorenzo was really great, you can ask him if you need something or looking for a place/restaurant. 
I already recommended Lorenzo and Anna Home to my friends who want to go to Rome."
37054,3813233,2013-03-18,3387510,FranÃ§ois,"It was really nice to discover Roma from Lorenzo's place. Located in a small pedestrian street, the surroundings are reality quiet even you're very close to Coliseum and Forums. Ten minutes from metro so you really do what you want to do.
Well appointed and clean, I strongly recommand!"
37054,3856194,2013-03-21,5319695,GaÃ«tan,"Anna Home is a great place to stay, clean, pretty and complete with equipment. In a nice building and pedestrian street.
Colosseo, Fontana di Trevi, Pantheon, Roman Forum and Capitol are at close walking distance.
I highly recommend this place to stay.
Lorenzo is a very friendly host, he took the time to give us all the necessary information about the flat, the city and also helpful advice.

37054,3926870,2013-03-28,4862184,Bruno,"La pasamos genial en el departamento de Lorenzo. Todo fue como lo prometido. EstÃ¡ a pasos del Forum y el Coliseo. Es casi de pelÃ­cula vivir en una calle como la del departamento de Lorenzo.
Gracias por todo.

PD: al taxista puede decirle que van al hotel forum para que entienda rÃ¡pidamente donde es el departamento. Ojo que no les quieran cobrar 1 euro por valija (a nosotros quisieron hacerlo)."
37054,4030119,2013-04-04,3953785,Jake,"Anna Home was perfect for our stay! It's literally across the street from the Roman Forum and around the corner from the Colosseum, as well as easy walking distance to all the other sites in Rome. The neighborhood has fantastic restaurant options, and you can easily escape the touristy feel, which is surprising given how close you are to the famous sights. The apartment has all the amenities you could need for your stay, and Lorenzo is an extremely gracious host. He even booked a shuttle to the airport for us when we needed an early morning ride, and had no phone to book an appointment."
37054,4064319,2013-04-07,4771948,Melissa,"Lorenzo was a very accommodating and a very helpful host.  From the time we booked our stay right up until the morning we left Rome.  Although we never met Lorenzo we welcomed to the apartment and to Rome with open arms.  There was an array of maps, guidebooks and directions and a list of things to do around the local area.  The area was probably the biggest draw card of all.  The Roman forum was just a few minutes walking and then the biggest sight of all, the Colosseum!  Overall we were very happy with the stay in the small, yet clean and cosy apartment.  "
37054,4155766,2013-04-15,3062805,Kate,"My mum was at Lorenzo's place and she found him very helpful, nice, he helped her getting information ab some visiting aspects. The place is in a perfect - spot close to all the important touristic attractins of the city. The apartment itself is very nice although it's really small. If you are outdoors the whole day, it doesn't really bother then. Thanks Lorenzo!"

He even met us late at night to let us in the apartment, which was in pristine condition and perfectly located in the old city centre. When we had problems with our taxi driver from the airport, Lorenzo talked to him and gave directions. We highly recommend his place - we walked everywhere and had our own small space in the city to rest after a long day. Lorenzo even had maps and city guides ready for us. Everything was so easy going, we couldn't ask for more and would love to come back!"

37054,5129752,2013-06-14,468411,Jonatan,"The apartment is very small but very pleasant as well. It's located in a hard to find little street, but it's right next to the Forum, the Colesseum and a lot of Rome's attractions. Lorenzo was very welcoming. We would stay there again."
37054,5174927,2013-06-17,5260852,Jimmy,"My wife and I traveled to Rome for the first time and stayed at Lorenzo's apartment near the Colosseum.  It was a lovely apartment and very clean and well kept.  The location was great and we were within walking distance to great shops, restaurants and amazing gelato places.  In addition, it was in a convenient location to a nearby metro stop so we were able to conveniently move around the city with ease.

Not only was the apartment great, but Lorenzo was an amazing host.  He was very easy to communicate with and extremely helpful and friendly.  He always made sure we were taken care of and went above and beyond to do so.  The airline we rode lost our check in luggage when we flew into Rome and Lorenzo worked out the details with the airline to not only get us our bag but he even delivered it to us himself on his motorbike!  We're not sure what we would have done if Lorenzo had not been as helpful and friendly as he was and he pretty much saved our entire trip!

We would highly recommend Lorenzo and his apartment to anyone considering a trip out to Rome.  Lorenzo made our time in Rome an unforgettable one!"
37054,5306202,2013-06-24,4230482,Ken,"Great location! Great host, Lorenzo met us at the place and made sure everything was in order.

Room good size for one person, bit of a tight fit for two, especially for more than one or two nights. The MAJOR PROBLEM with the room (note that it is a room, with its own entrance to the hallway - much to small to be called an apartment) is that it lacks proper ventilation and has a very serious mold problem. This is a serious concern for people like me who have asthma. The air conditioner is really useless ( the room is muggier and warmer in the morning than is the air outside), and it drips condensation water into the room rather than outside. Since the windows open onto an interior patio walkway it is not entirely secure to leave them open. 

To summarize: a great value room for a single traveller with no respiratory issues, otherwise maybe not unless the ventilation / AC question gets sorted out.

The locations is near the Colosseum and Forum but also in a very quiet and quaint neighborhood with lots of restaurant options. 

Lorenzo was an great host and met us on the street when we had trouble finding the apartment.

We would highly recommend Lorenzo and his apartment to anyone considering a trip out to Rome. "
37054,5880989,2013-07-21,4094010,Sarah,"This flat was in a FABULOUS location.  If you want to be able to walk to the Roman Forum, the Colosseum and the train station in under 5 minutes, then this is the place for you.  It is really tiny but fully equipped with everything you need.  The building has a lot of character and the neighbors were very friendly.  The building had some trouble with their air conditioning when we stayed there but Lorenzo took care of it for us immediately and was so nice and very accommodating and easy to get a hold of whenever we needed anything.  This is a cute stay in a great location!"
37054,6018481,2013-07-27,1103569,Francine,Lorenzo was the prefect host. Very helpful and kind.  The flat looked exactly as it did in the photo -- a cute little doll house.  The location was perfect. Everything was within walking distance -- you couldn't walk 100 feet without running into ruins!.The piazza nearby was a great place to hang out and get a slice of Roman life by sitting out on the fountain in the evenings. I very much recommend Anna Home for the single woman vacationing alone. The area was safe to walk and the building was very secure.  Loved it!
37054,6073424,2013-07-29,6822010,Shaun,"Very clean apartment, with a great location.
Air con works well - needed in Rome summer.
Great place to drop your bags and rest your head, don't expect too much more (although why go to Rome and spend time in your room)
Perfect for a travelling couple / 1 person.
Would definitely stay again, host is super helpful! 

Thanks Lorenzo "

He was so flexible with meeting my wife and me after super delays with our arrival, and his apartment's location is so awesome: in the center of everything in Rome and so convenient. We ended up doing tourist-things in the mornings, stopping by the apartment in the middle of the day just to relax, recharge, cool off, and go out to continue our adventures in the afternoon. The studio may be small but totally perfect and efficient for Rome adventures. :)"
37054,6744022,2013-08-23,4107813,Jeremy,"Lorenzo was awesome and so was the place. It's ridiculously close to the colosseum. Beautiful place, would definitely stay again. "
37054,7006264,2013-09-03,3225766,Nada,"Lorenzo was a great host - always available and on time! Checking in and out was not a problem at all! The apartment is small but perfect for two and has everything you need - if you eat mainly in restaurants. If you want to cook there, be aware that only very easy dishes are possible because the kitchen is rather small and therefore moderately equipped. The location was amazing - we could do all the sightseeing by foot except for the Vatican! All in all i absolutely recommend it!"
37054,7477604,2013-09-22,5876593,Lisa,"The appartment really is in a great location; the neighbourhoud is nice and let alone the view you have by walking outside is astonishing. The flat is small and cosy, perfect for 2 people's stay in Roma. Communication with Lorenzo was quick and uncomplicated - would definitely come again!"
37054,7575173,2013-09-25,6512193,Boris,"if you are looking for great location, responsible and reliable host contact Lorenzo immediately.  the apartment is small, but well equipped and .perfect for a couple. everything is in very close proximity - Forum Colosseum.
there is a local restaurant "" Mario"" which we hardly recommend to go

37054,7630031,2013-09-27,4113845,Wei-Ling,Lorenzo is really nice! Had a nice stay at his room!
37054,7792057,2013-10-03,7988070,Amy,"we had a wonderful  stay at this adorable flat. Lorenzo was very helpful in helping us find the apartment. I would definitely recommend a stay here! Very clean, great location and good value. "
37054,7844712,2013-10-06,4501268,Elisse,"Lorenzo's apartment is the perfect place to stay while in Rome- it was extremely clean, a good size, and close to all the major attractions. 

Lorenzo was so lovely, even though we were running a bit late! He ran through all we needed to know, and directions on how to get to the sights. We didn't need to use public transport once, everything is walking distance.

The best part was all the thoughtful touches, like guidebooks, shampoo, milk etc. it is also very safe, secure, and quiet at night.

Highly recommend! We hope to be back one day. 

"
37054,7958533,2013-10-10,6067484,Caylyn,"Lorenzo was on time and the location was perfect very close to the forum and coliseum! Would not recommend for more than 2 people but my husband and I really enjoyed our time in Rome:)
"
37054,8037819,2013-10-14,362882,Amy,"Lorenzo is a great host. He is super responsive and very thoughtful of his guest. His place is small, but very homely, just right for two people. It's very close to the Colosseum, metro and bus stations. I definitely recommended it for anyone looking for a place for their stay in Rome!  Thanks Lorenzo! "
37054,8404834,2013-10-29,5361916,MagalÃ­,"Lorenzo nos recibiÃ³ amablemente, a pesar de nuestra demora! Excelente ubicaciÃ³n! Servicio, comodidades y limpieza excelentes! Nos sorprendimos gratamente con todo lo necesario para tomar un buen desayuno y empezar el dÃ­a con mucha energÃ­a! Gracias! "
37054,8718515,2013-11-13,9499913,Maggie,"I stayed at the Anna Home for 4 nights. It's a cozy space perfect for two with all the necessarily amenities! When people say it's close to the Roman Forum, it's true; the apartment is literally steps away from the historic site. Lorenzo was a nice host who patiently accommodated us even though we were late. This apartment is highly recommended for those who want to stay close to the city center!"
37054,8754040,2013-11-16,9033653,Dan,"Lorenzo is prompt, really friendly, and all-around the best host we had during our two-week trip in Europe! First of all, he is really easy to communicate with and met us at his apartment exactly when he said he would be there. Check-in was very thorough and helpful, and Lorenzo took the time to show us all the features of the unit and made sure we asked him any questions before he left. The apartment itself was exactly as described on the website, and it's a really good location and size for a pair of travelers in Rome. The Forum is a 5 minute walk away, and the Pantheon was 15 minutes away. The unit also was fully stocked with juice, milk, coffee, tea, some snacks, lots of towels, and toiletries. Lorenzo clearly knows how to treat his Airbnb guests well!  "
37054,8952040,2013-11-27,2919352,Daniel,"Lorenzo: puntual, amable, colaborador y disponible 
Anna Home: centrico, limpio, curioso, con todo lo que uno necesita

General: una fantastica opciÃ³n"
37054,9005306,2013-12-01,9043995,John,"Lorenzo was, without a doubt, the best host I have ever had when using Airbnb! After being very quick to respond during the booking process, Lorenzo was nice enough to meet up with us at an easy to find location and then led us to the apartment. The apartment itself was clean, cozy and has a truly unbeatable location. To top it all off, Lorenzo included so many fantastic personal touches like having bottled water in the fridge, mini toiletries in the bathroom and hard candies on the table. It felt like we were staying at an old friend's house! If you're lucky enough to find that Lorenzo's apartment is open when you're looking to stay in Rome, jump at the chance to book this place. You will not regret it! :-)"
37054,9319705,2013-12-21,2831391,Marissa,"My parents stayed in Lorenzo's place for two days and he greeted them with helpful tips and friendly assistance. The apartment has ideal location with the Roman Forum and Colloseum a few meters away. It is also close to a bus stop which connects directly to the Vatican. The apartment was clean and has everything you need for your stay in Rome. Lorenzo also left some juice, tea and coffee and other complimentary snacks which was very welcome after a long train ride."
37054,9460709,2013-12-30,4304718,TimothÃ©,"Petit studio trÃ¨s charmant. La localisation est tout simplement parfaite! En plein coeur de Rome, proche du ColisÃ©, de Termini, du centre Historique. IdÃ©al!"
37054,9702268,2014-01-06,9271351,Catherine,"Lorenzo is a lovely and helpful gentlemen. We got lost trying to find the place and he kindly guided us to the nearest post office on Via Cavour and met us there and walked us to the place. ""Anna Home"" is very strategically located, less than a minute walk from the ruins of Temple of Mars Ultore which connects to the main street; Via Dei Fori Imperial. The place itself is a really lovely place to stay. Size wise, it was just right for me and my boyfriend. It was also warm enough as is without us having to switch on the heater, and we stayed there in winter (January). 
Overall, strategic location, lovely place to stay, and one awesome host. Definitely recommended."

I highly recommend it!"

The place was spotless, there was even juice and milk in the fridge and some croissants for breakfast, and Lorenzo was really friendly and accomodating. Will definitely stay here again when next in Rome! Thanks so much!!"
37054,12202056,2014-04-26,7773169,Ulla Birgitte,"This was our first Airbnb experience and Lorenzo has been a perfect host. He has responded promptly to all communication. He met us and introduced us to the studio and he was very kind and understanding despite our slight delay. He even came back and changed a broken light bulb a the first possible opportunity. The restaurant he recommended turned out to be a perfect last evening in Rome. Anna Home is our new favorite place in the whole world. It is clean, functional, cosy and extremely quiet apart from the sounds of everyday life in the charming atrium. And the best of all; location, location, location !! Walk to all the sights and enjoy the best neighborhood in Rome. If you find Anna Home free on your travel dates, we recommend you book it right away ! We are ready for our next new favorite place out there and it will be Airbnb thanks to Lorenzo and Anna Home. "
37054,12771299,2014-05-11,2410267,AgustÃ­n,"Me and my girlfriend Caro stayed in the apartment for 4 nights. The bedroom is not so big, but really cozy and perfect for two people. 
Lorenzo let us feel as we were at home, giving us a complimentary tea/coffe for breakfast and answering all our questions. 
The apartment is really close to the Colisseum (7min walk). 
To sum up, great place: clean, cozy, safe, beautiful neighbourhood. 
Excellent cost/benefit! 
Me and Caro highly recommend Anna home!!"
37054,12878240,2014-05-13,11464804,Kseniya,"We loved staying at Lorenzo's wonderful home in the heart if Roma! The house is situated in the center of historical Roma and it takes just 5 min to Vittoriano and Roman forum. The apartment is very comfortable and quite, and moreover Lorenzo gave us a map of the city and  told us everything what we need about Roma. Also Lorenzo brought for us some food and drinks for breakfast! Thank you Lorenzo!!"
37054,13128002,2014-05-20,5633284,Doreen,Perfect Location near Forum Romanum. Apartment is Quite small (like expected) but very nice. Lorenzo is a fantastic host giving good recommendations.

37054,13649009,2014-06-02,7559508,Michelle,"My boyfriend and I had the most wonderful experience at Lorenzo's bnb in Rome :) Lorenzo was very detailed in explaining the amenities of his home and offered many useful resources about Rome tourism. His bnb is very clean and in a prime location very close to the Forum and Colosseum. In addition, Lorenzo never hesitated to help us when we had questions, and even booked a late night taxi for us since we did not have access to local phone. 
Overall, if you are looking to stay in a clean, convenient bnb in an authentic Roman neighborhood, this is for you. 

Thanks for everything Lorenzo! :)"

37054,15440752,2014-07-09,7678969,Rebekka,We stayed for 4 nights at Anna Home. The location is perfect. You are right in the middle of the center and everything is in walking distance. I really liked that it is in the back of the house so it is really quiet and the apartment stays really cool. The apartment is perfect for a city trip not for longer because the apartment is really small. 
37054,15525544,2014-07-11,13170274,Jason,"Great location, close to coliseum. We walked to all attractions from here, all necessary items in the apartment including channel which had the World Cup! Quaint little street with laundry round the corner. Would recommend."

37054,16208732,2014-07-23,16403058,Justin,"The location and price were great for visiting the ancient rome sights. The one-room apartment was about half the size of a hotel room, but for a couple traveling, there was just enough room. We did take advantage of the kitchen and made some pasta from the grocery store just down the street.

Lorenzo was also very helpful and communicated regularly before and during our stay. I would definitely work with Lorenzo again."
37054,16393986,2014-07-27,10362984,Jerome,"Lorenzo was an excellent  host. He met us right on time and was nice enough to sit with us and answer our questions. The flat is in the Monti neighborhood in Rome. Great place with restaurants, pubs, pizza and markets on every block. The gelateria      Close B&B offered 70 flavors!
The flat is small but does the job if you want to be right in the middle of old Rome. The building is secure and the neighborhood safe. 
The only criticism we had was that horizontal  surfaces for ""stuff"" is at a minimum so we had to move luggage around and there was a baby in another flat that cried a bit. However, they put her to bed by 9 and she didn't wake until 7:30 or so.  That being said we didn't turn on the AC until the day we left so our windows were open to the central courtyard. It was like going back in time.  We really enjoyed being part of a lovely neighborhood instead of just a hotel room!"
37054,16651427,2014-07-31,7085378,David,"Lorenzo's apartment was very well located about 10 minutes north of the Colosseum. There is a very good restaurant just minutes away called La Taverna dei Fori Imperiali. Make sure you make either Lunch or Dinner reservations here. A really good gelato place is also near by called La Dolce Vita.

We were met by his friend Mauro, who got us inside and showed us to our place. The apartment was as described and shown in the photos. It was very clean and small. The only place you may have an issue is the bathroom as it has a shorter ceiling than the rest of the place. (If you are over 6 ft tall, the shower might be a problem). The bed is a pull out sofa and was the only negative thing I can think about. The side closer to the wall is not very comfortable, so I didn't sleep very well. 

Communication with Lorenzo was excellent as he was always VERY fast to respond. We had a great stay and thank you very much!"
37054,17201958,2014-08-09,8240953,DÃ©borah,"Cet appartement est parfait pour deux, fonctionnel, calme et sÃ©curisÃ©.  Ce studio est Ã  proximitÃ© de tous les monuments (ColisÃ©e, Piazza de Venezia, Fontaine de TrÃ©viâ¦) ce qui est trÃ¨s pratique. Lorenzo est un hÃ´te disponible.

Apartment is located on quite sidestreet with windows to the backyard so nobody could disturb you. 2 minutes walk to Roman Forum, 3 mins to Colosseum. 
Lorenzo is a great host and was taking care about us before, during and after our stay. Will definitely stay here during next visit. Highly recommend to everyone!"

37054,19455192,2014-09-13,13754352,Woustina,"Lorenzo was a very friendly and helpful host. This apartment is suitable for a short stay in Rome. The location is ideal for exploring the city with many attractions in walking distance. The bed I was very comfortable for a fold out. The apartment was tidy, but not the cleanest. The windows open up to a walk way which doesn't allow for privacy and with the windows closed the apartment does not get any fresh air or natural light so it get a quite stuffy. Also the bathroom ceiling is quite low, which isn't clear in the photos or description. My husband is 6'3"" and could not stand up straight in the bathroom. 

All in all it's fine for a short stay on a budget. Thanks for having us Lorenzo! "
37054,20081883,2014-09-23,15951217,Katharina,"We had a great time at Anna Home! The apartment was clean, well-equipped and quiet. Although it is quite small, the location is just perfect to explore Rome. We will certainly come back!"

37054,20641491,2014-10-03,7853453,Corinna,Lorenzo is a perfect host! Great Location for a City Trip to rome! Thank you for your Insider Information about Restaurants and sights!

37054,20944221,2014-10-08,8991045,Jenny,"Lorenzo was very helpful throughout our entire planning process. After arriving late, due to plane delays, we were greeted immediately. Lorenzo explained everything, included a map, and suggested places to eat. His place is compact, but it had everything my husband and I needed. The house is located in a great area, easily accessible to everything you would want to see. We walked everywhere, even back from the Vatican! Lorenzo provided all the amenities you would find in a nice hotel (snacks, drinks, toiletries, hairdryer). Even though I brought my own stuff, it was nice to see that he thought of everything. The air conditioning was a nice perk for when we got back from 10 hours of walking! Since the place cools down quickly, we turned it off during the night and it remained a good temperature. His house is very secure, and we would definitely recommend it. Hopefully we will meet again!"
37054,21071464,2014-10-11,15885142,Isabel,"We stayed at Lorenzo's apartment for 2 nights with a very easy check in as we were met at the apartment.
The apartment itself was exactly as described and just like the pictures. It is a small studio apartment but it was great for us as we were only in Rome for such a short stay. The apartment was very clean and we even had water, chocolate croissants, milk & apricot nectar provided.
The location itself is fantastic, major tourist sites like the collesium & Fontana di trevi were a 10min walk away and the walks are through cobbled streets with lots to see. We took a taxi to the Vatican and it was only â¬10 so getting around is really easy. 
Would recommend if you are wanting to be walking distance to plenty of tourist attractions."
37054,21332317,2014-10-15,4182252,Bonnie,"Lorenzo met us on time, gave us personal tips of the area and responded to  all of our emails in a timely manner. The location was terrific and the neighborhood was as described with plenty of restaurants nearby. The apartment was small for two people but because we were rarely there, it was doable . The kitchen was not set up for efficiently cooking  meals (space and equipment) as we had hoped . There was a leak and other repairs  that Lorenzo stated he would check into prior to the next visitor's stay. The maps and breakfast items were appreciated. It was nosier than we expected  when the windows were left open for ventilation. Bed was comfortable."
37054,21456867,2014-10-18,14918877,Yousun,"Pros
- location. Close to Roman Forum and Colosseum.
But it was about 25mins away from the main train station.
- Breakfast. Milk,juice and some bread were prepared for us. 
- Towels. We stayed for 3 days and we've got enough towels to use.
- Lorenzo was very helpful and communication was good
-Had a lift which is helpful with heavy luggage
-Fast wifi
-Fairly quiet at night
-Good amount of hangers for clothes

Cons
- The blanket  was on top of the toilet ceiling with some dust, so we were not sure if it is clean or not.
- The room was very humid. Specially I could smell mould in the kitchen.
-Water was dripping from the air conditioner even though we didn't use it at all. 
- The toilet seiling was not high enough for my husband. He is 185cm tall and his head could almost touch it."

The location is very close to Roman Forum, Collesium and Piazza Venezia but a bit far from Spanish steps. 
Lorenzo was very helpful he gave some tips.

Il nous a beaucoup arrangÃ© en nous attendant malgrÃ© un avion tardif et nous a trÃ¨s bien accueilli et conseillÃ© pour notre arrivÃ©e ! (Comment venir, comment trouver un taxi, Lorenzo nous a Ã©galement donnÃ© une carte le jour de notre arrivÃ©e)
L'appartement est trÃ¨s bien situÃ© et permet de tout visiter Ã  pieds. C'est petit (kitchenette un peu petite pour cuisiner, clic clac) mais trÃ¨s bien pour un sÃ©jour Ã  2!"
37054,22816142,2014-11-15,23537318,Troy,"Lorenzo was a fantastic host.  He met us with a smile, recommended a few places to see, and was very quick to respond to a few questions I had during my stay.  The apartment is small but there was plenty of room for the two of us.  The location was perfect for our walks to the Colosseum and Roman Forum.  I would definitely stay here again."
37054,22956094,2014-11-18,22876509,Marie Pierre,"L'accueil que nous avons reÃ§u de la part de Lorenzo a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s chaleureux. L'appartement correspondait tout a fait Ã  la description faite.
Le quartier est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et a une trÃ¨s bonne situation gÃ©ographique."
37054,23720394,2014-12-08,13378535,Jordan,"If you are looking for an affordable place to stay in central Rome, easily accessible by public transport and within walking distance of all Rome's most iconic landmarksâthis is it. Couldn't have have asked for a better place to stay for my first trip to Rome. Lorenzo is a great hostâquick to communicate and very well organized. He was even able to accommodate an unexpected flight delay with a flexible check in time. The apartment is as it appears in photos, with the added benefit of some lovely welcoming touches left by Lorenzo. It was comfortable and quiet even while being in the midst of one of Rome's biggest tourist zones. Would highly recommend staying here on you next trip to Rome. "
37054,24157088,2014-12-21,12295926,Edoardo,"Ottima posizione, l'appartamento Ã¨ completo di tutto, fantastico per un week end a spasso per Roma. 
Lorenzo Ã¨ stato puntuale e disponibile.
Raccomandato per coppie"
37054,25296511,2015-01-11,22025974,Gianna,"Lorenzo was a friendly and helpful host,  giving us helpful hints on where to eat and suggesting itineraries.  The apartment is in a magnificent position. Unfortunately, the photos are a little misleading, and make the apartment seem bigger than it is. The cost is too high for the size of this apartment. Despite this, we had a wonderful weekend in Rome! Many thanks Lorenzo."
37054,25512132,2015-01-18,14197147,Daniel,Thanks for the stay. Great location :) good contact with the host. 
37054,26255996,2015-02-08,14195776,Ilaria,"Il mio Ã¨ stato un soggiorno piacevolissimo: l'appartamento Ã¨ molto pulito e silenzioso, un ottimo punto di partenza per esplorare il caratteristico quartiere Monti e le bellezze di Roma. L'accoglienza non poteva essere migliore: Lorenzo, oltre a essere molto simpatico, Ã¨ anche estremamente disponibile e attento a dare informazioni e suggerimenti. "
37054,26431141,2015-02-12,26244115,Gelareh,My son and I felt very welcome by Lorenzo who is very friendly and even helped with our luggage and got us a cab when leaving the apartment. The apartment is quiet which is exactly what we needed after walking around the city for so many hours each day. It is also close to two metro stops and walking distance to most of the attractions.
37054,26602196,2015-02-16,19424007,Vincent,"Le studio se situe en plein centre de Rome Ã  200 mÃ¨tres du ColisÃ©e.
C'est le grand plus ! Il s'agit d'un studio, bien Ã©quipÃ© (le lit est un clic clac c'est ce que nous n'avons pas apprÃ©ciÃ©) et entretenu dans un immeuble de trÃ¨s bonne facture.
Lorenzo est trÃ¨s accueillant, il a pris le temps de nous donner quelques conseils pour passer un bon sÃ©jour."
37054,27095695,2015-02-25,24336506,Azul,"Great place, perfectly located in a quiet street but two blocks away from the Forum, very clean and with everything you need for two people. Super recommended."
37054,27429733,2015-03-04,14747466,Blazej,Great service from Lorenzo. The appartment is in the heart of rome in an historical cute neighbourhood with young people an good placed to go out.
37054,27551293,2015-03-07,6779658,"Nicole, Pauline Et Pierre","L'appartement est pratique et bien placÃ©, nous Ã©tions trÃ¨s heureux de ce sÃ©jour. Toutefois j'ai vraiment eu l'impression d'Ãªtre Ã  l'hÃ´tel, fini la chaleur tant aimÃ© des lieux habitÃ©s, les appartements airbnb plein de vie et de dÃ©tails charmants de la vie des gens. Ici c'est une chambre d'hÃ´tel terne et sans Ã¢me avec une cuisine (ce qui est certe trÃ¨s pratique mais il manque une passoire). Et il faut check out avant 10h pour les clients suivants... 
exactement comme Ã  l'hÃ´tel!
Nous n'avons pas croisÃ© Lorenzo."
37054,28003525,2015-03-16,26864120,Rhiannon,"Lorenzo's flat is in an amazing location, next to the Roman forum and a short walk from all the major attractions. The metro is only a short walk away but we didn't need to use it!
Lorenzo was excellent at communicating with us and very accommodating, even letting us have a late check out. The flat was very easy to find and has all the basic essentials such as towels and breakfast food and coffee. The sofa bed is extremely comfortable and it's a very quiet flat despite its great location.
Highly recommend this flat, a great base from which to explore the city."
37054,28248052,2015-03-21,25347427,Jacklyn,The host was very welcoming when we arrived. The place was walking distance of the Roman Forum and Colosseum and many restaurants. The place is small and fit my travel partner and I perfectly. 
37054,28375895,2015-03-23,21646259,Robert,"Ciao Lorenzo It was a perfect apartment. Nice clean.good shower!
 The next time in Roma i will choose Lorenzo's place.

Robert"
37054,28699825,2015-03-29,3814155,Angus,"My girlfriend and I were staying in Rome for three nights so were looking for reasonably priced accommodation near the centre; so Lorenzo's flat suited us well. It's quite basic (the bed is a sofa bed) and small, however it's clean, secure and has a well-equipped bathroom. Lorenzo was very welcoming and helpful; giving us advice on traveling around Rome, how to get to the airport and places to eat nearby. The location is fantastic - it's five minutes from the Colosseum and Forum and the surrounding Monti area is full of nice bars, restaurants and shops. Also very close to a Metro station.

Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for cheap, basic but nice, central accommodation for a short break in Rome."
37054,29158152,2015-04-05,24908310,Ella,"It was great staying at Lorenzos place. It was small but had everything, and was located very close to everything in Rome, we walked everywhere. Thank you for a good experience."
37054,29732709,2015-04-12,14977238,Elisabeth,Le logement est petit mais confortable et propre. Il est vraiment bien situÃ©. Lorenzo est sympa. Je le recommande.
37054,30065925,2015-04-17,14641597,Carole,"Excellent sÃ©jour dans cet appartement trÃ¨s trÃ¨s bien situÃ©! De plus, c'est trÃ¨s propre, le minimum de toilette et de petit dÃ©jeuner est Ã  disposition. Le quartier est super sympa, le ColisÃ©e et le forum tout proches. Je recommande vivement, c'est une chance d'Ãªtre hÃ©bergÃ© dans le centre. Lorenzo est trÃ¨s disponible, trÃ¨s accueillant et sympathique. Merci!"
37054,30195571,2015-04-19,24585025,Tiziana,"L' appartamento, ben arredato con tutto il necessario per un confortevole soggiorno, Ã¨ sito in posizione strategica per la visita della cittÃ .. aprendo il portone di casa si ha un fantastico scorcio dei fori imperiali, con pochi passi si Ã¨ giÃ  nel cuore pulsante della cittÃ ! Raggiungere l'appartamento dalla stazione termini Ã¨ davvero facile, anche a piedi (poco meno di 2 km).

Lorenzo Ã¨ stato veramente gentile e disponibile, ha atteso il mio arrivo con pazienza (il mio volo era in tarda serata) e si Ã¨ reso sempre reperibile anche il soggiorno per qualsiasi domanda o informazione!
Tutto veramente perfetto! Consigliatissimo!"
37054,30647059,2015-04-25,21643910,Kate,"This apartment was great! Precisely as pictured and a block from the Roman Forum. Perfect location, safe area and nice building. I was unable to turn off the tile heat so I found it quite warm in the room, even with windows open to get airflow. Beyond that, everything was perfect :) "
37054,30920698,2015-04-29,16369037,Tom And Lauren,We had a fantastic stay! So close to everything especially as it was our first time in Rome. The room was perfect and we made some yummy pasta at the apartment. 
37054,31505154,2015-05-06,25565234,Stephanie,"This apartment was perfect for our stay in Rome. Clean, well situated and had everything we needed. Lorenzo was really helpful and told us everything we needed to know. I would definitely stay here again!"
37054,31633584,2015-05-08,7779339,Robin,"This is a difficult review for me as the location and Lorenzo are wonderful!You're next to the forum and many of the oldest sites in Rome. The room was exactly as described in his current listing. Lorenzo was an excellent host and highly responsive to our needs. He got a private driver there and back without batting an eye. My issues are largely due to things that are or may be out of his control. First, We went to Rome during an uncharacteristic hot spell. As it was not ""summer,"" however, it is my understanding that the property owner (i.e., not Lorenzo) would not permit the property to use Air Conditioning. This turned the apartment into a unbearable place to rest during the daytime. Second, I would have sworn the listing stated at the time I booked it that it had a washer. This became an issue because of the heat (see above). I could be wrong, however; I frequently am so I don't want to penalize him too much. If not for the heat, this would have been a great stay. 

My advice then is simple--if it appears Rome will be hot during the time you are staying in Rome, check to see if the A/C will be available."
37054,31930545,2015-05-12,13165761,Heather,"Lorenzo was great and very welcoming. He had a very clean and lovely studio that we stayed at, close to anything and everything!! Great location, very well kept and simple to locate after daily adventures. All around great host. Thank you, Lorenzo! "
37054,32454004,2015-05-18,21557287,Fernando,"The apartment is very nice! Compact, clean and extremelly well located! The hoster, Lorenzo was great! I would easily recomend to my friends!"
37054,32878643,2015-05-23,25697453,Christopher,"Lorenzo was the perfect host. I was almost an hour late arriving from my train. He was patient and waited till o arrived. His studio was very clean and the location was excellent. He also offered me very good tourists information. Mille Grazie Lorenzo.
Ciao,
Christopher Woolson"
37054,33896507,2015-06-02,27201058,Aurore,"Nous avons Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s bien accueillis par Lorenzo, il est trÃ¨s gentil et Ã  rÃ©pondu Ã  toutes nos questions avant mÃªme qu'on ne les pose. L'appartement Ã©tait tout Ã  fait conforme aux photos. Lorenzo nous a laissÃ© de quoi petit dÃ©jeuner, lait , jus d'orange, confiture... c'est trÃ¨s apprÃ©ciable. Le quartier est trÃ¨s calme et malgrÃ© la chaleur fin mai, l'appartement reste frais. Nous avons eu l'impression de vivre vraiment Ã  Rome pendant quelques jours. "
37054,34126889,2015-06-05,7362782,Lynn,I loved the apartment!  It was clean and well situated for seeing Rome.  Bed was comfy.  Lorenzo was a wonderful and helpful host and even helped me get transport to the airport.
37054,34399579,2015-06-08,24776800,Kevin,"The neighborhood was great. If you like foid, coffees, smiling young people hangong around a gountain with drinks and super close from the main attractions, you are at the right place!

It wasn't complicated at all to find the place and somebody was waiting for us. I recommand this place if you expectbto not spend your time in the room. It is super small but you're not in Roma to stay inside your place!"
37054,34621685,2015-06-10,27326675,Amanda,The apartment was right next to the Forum.  Great location and accomodations.  Highly recommend!!
37054,35372233,2015-06-18,23937862,Andre,"Lorenzo es un chico simpatico que cuida muy bien a sus huespedes. Nos recibio con una sonrisa a pesar de nuestra demora y nos dejo buenas recomendaciones a donde ir a comer, tomar una cerveza etc. 
La ubicacion del piso es perfecta e ideal para una estancia corta. "
37054,35636281,2015-06-21,498422,Nadja,"Lorenzo was very welcoming when we arrived. The studio is perfectly located in a quite street near the forum and the colosseum. Many bars and restaurants in this area as well. Walking distance to the Metro (Colosseo) was 5 minutes. Very good area to stay for a weekend. 
Our stay was perfect, the studio has everything you need. (shampoo, towels, breakfast, wifi, hair dryer, kitchen, a/c) highly recommended. thanks for having us lorenzo. "
37054,36090722,2015-06-25,13009132,Carlos,"Lorenzo is great! We met at the time we agreed, the apartment was exactly as described and even better. The location is just amazing, less than 100 meters to the forums and couple of blocks to the coliseum. There are lots of bars and restaurants around, for lovely walks at sunset or night. Thanks Lorenzo!"
37054,36360352,2015-06-28,23812397,Alissa,"Lorenzo was great and easy to communicate with. The location was wonderful. The apartment was quite smaller than I expected, but that was on me--no misrepresentation. Lorenzo had milk, orange juice, pastries, and shampoo & bodywash just for us. The futon was quite comfortable to sleep on. 

The only disappointing thing was the condition of the apartment. The pictures show a bright, white, flawless interior, while in reality the place was in a bit of disrepair. The fridge was musty and a bit moldy around the edges. "
37054,36665353,2015-06-30,30908939,Carena,The listing description was very accurate. The apartment is in prime location. It was conveniently close to the colosseum. Lorenzo was a great host. He was there to let us into the apartment right away.
37054,37840015,2015-07-11,27900149,Nira,"The apartment is in a good location, we walked to all the attractions. The only place we took the bus to was the Vatican. The apartment was spotless clean when we arrived. We had communication issues with other Airbnb's but not with Lorenzo, in fact he's the one who contacted us first to make arrangements to meet. "
37054,40428753,2015-07-31,27002338,Austin,"Great location, cozy apartment and very gracious host. The place is small but has everything you need and more for a trip to Rome. The AC was great, even with the heat wave we experienced. Don't be discouraged by the futon, it felt like a regular bed. Definitely recommend this place!"

Lorenzo was a nice host, he was there to greet us when we arrived and gave good recommendations and helped to book a car from the airport. The bed was very comfortable even though it was a futon, we slept great. We would definitely recommend to stay here during a trip to Rome."
37054,47621268,2015-09-21,31044699,Elizabeth,Lorenzo met us when we got to Rome and helped us bring our bags in! His apartment was perfect for our 3 days stay and he was very easy to get a hold of!

37054,49202035,2015-10-02,30204748,Evelyn,"Lorenzo's apartment was the perfect stay in Rome! Even though it is centrally located and within walking distance to all the major sights, it's in a tucked away quite street overlooking a little courtyard, providing the perfect scene for a good nights rest. The apartment is small but unless your planning on spending your trip inside the apartment it should be plenty spacious for two. Everything was very clean and Lorenzo leaves snacks you can munch on for breakfast. The sofa bed is very comfortable and doesn't even feel like a sofa bed! Will definitely be coming back in the future! Thanks Lorenzo! "

37054,51018869,2015-10-17,41000101,Garett,Kind and generous host. He greeted us on time (we actually were running early and we ran into him on the street and he let us in) at his place.  He sat down with us and talked through ideas of what to do and places he recommended to eat. Amazing location - would recommend to friends! 
37054,51521757,2015-10-21,5041183,Angela,"
Pros: Plentiful of towels, good location, very secure building. Communication was easy check in / check out.
Cons: The wifi is NOT password protected - it's wide open. This apt is ediquate for just one person, too small for two. Bathroom ceiling has been lowered - not enough room in the shows for anyone over 5'5"".
Bed is NOT comfortable - almost not fit to sleep on. It tilts to the middle.
Too pricy for the value.



"
37054,51721595,2015-10-24,42313531,Dan,"Lorenzo was an excellent host.   He was very patient with us as our train was much later than anticipated.  The apartment was clean, and was exactly as described.  The location is amazing, especially if planning on visiting the Colosseum or Roman Forum.  Either was less than a 5 minute walk.  Lorenzo also made great restaurant suggestions, and provided us with  all the necessary information to get around Rome, and the easiest way to get back to FCO airport. "

37054,53800438,2015-11-12,7650894,Sierra,Apartment was exactly as pictured! Perfect location! Would def recommend it!!!! 
37054,54376202,2015-11-19,20732820,Sema,"The location was perfect, we went everywhere but Vatican by foot. Lorenzo welcomed us warmly and gave tips about places around. Kitchen appliances could be renewed. There were coffee, milk, tea, biscuits etc. in the kitchen for breakfast. Really nice for short stays rather than long ones. "
37054,54922985,2015-11-25,48769649,Douglas,"Fantastic, cozy place. Lorenzo is a kind host, pointing us to lovely restaurants and arranging car service to the airport for our very early flight home. The flat is exactly as advertised: small, comfortable, perfectly located, a true gem. Highly recommend both the space and the host. "

37054,55929476,2015-12-07,31958147,Carola,"Anna Home Ã¨ perfetta se volete visitare Roma senza avere problemi di mezzi di trasporto, infatti, essendo nel favoloso quartiere di Monti potete raggiungere tutti i luoghi interessanti di Roma a piedi, compresa la vicinissima stazione di Termini. L'appartamento Ã¨ piccolo ed Ã¨ perfetto per singoli o coppie che hanno intenzione di passare la maggior parte del tempo a visitare la cittÃ . Lorenzo Ã¨ stato davvero gentile consigliandoci dei ristoranti molto molto buoni. Per concludere, che dire, uscire dal portone di casa e avere la vista sul foro di Augusto Ã¨ una sensazione impagabile. Ottimo rapporto qualitÃ /prezzo. Grazie Lorenzo."
37054,56306814,2015-12-12,37844335,Mikaela,"We had a great stay at this apartment! Although it is small, it is perfect for two people and close to many attractions! We would recommend this! Lorenzo was also very helpful and booked a taxi for us to the airport when we left!"

the place is perfect to stay. its very quiet and all the important places are at walkng distance."
37054,59358715,2016-01-10,43696900,Elizabeth,"Lorenzoâs apt is everything it advertises as: modern, clean and quiet, Lorenzo even left complimentary items such as coffee or shampoo. The bed was very comfortable for a futon and we slept great! In regards to other reviews on the apartmentâs size we found it was more than adequate room for two people. I think what is underrated is the leafy garden of the buildingâs courtyard, it was a beautiful surprise and very tranquil as is the surrounding neighbourhood. We were able to walk or cycle (bike hire on the next road!) everywhere as main attractions were on our doorstep. Lorenzo himself was very friendly and professional, he ran through everything with us such as how to pull out the bed or how to turn on the gas stove. We only met him on arrival but he was very quick to reply to any texts. We have no complaints we really enjoyed our stay thanks to Lorenzoâs place, thank-you!"
37054,59582844,2016-01-12,47144035,Kate,"Lorenzo was very helpful in getting to and from the apartment! The location could not have been better. Steps from several monuments and just a few minutes aways from most others. Small, but just as advertised! Loved it!!"
37054,60389842,2016-01-23,24108149,Fernando,"Lorenzo was an excellent host. He informed us of everything related to the apartment and the neighbourhood. We enjoyed our stay in Rome very much, very much thanks to the tips given by Lorenzo. The apartment is very well located near the roman forum and in a very picturesque neighbourhood. We hope to go back again and we highly recommend the apartment and the host Lorenzo."
37054,60751171,2016-01-27,39055490,Susana,Lorenzo is a very nice person and his house it's in a perfect place to 2 persons.He was very hepfull. The place is near to everything that you need to know in Rome.

37054,64584802,2016-03-06,29148469,Daniela,"Pasamos unos dias increibles!! La ubicaciÃ³n es perfecta. El departamento es tal cual se ve en las fotos. 
Lorenzo muy amable y atento en todo, hasta nos dejo para desayunar. Volveriamos sin dudarlo a su departamento."

37054,67471465,2016-03-29,36404022,Hyunjin,"We had a wonderful stay at Lorenzo's place.
The location was fantastic!! It is ~4 min walk to the entrance of Roman Forum and ~8 min walk to Colosseum.
On the day of arrival, we had trouble find his place but Lorenzo was kind enough to come out to Roman Forum to get us.
I recommend his place to anybody who visit Rome.
"
37054,68737169,2016-04-06,59898308,Jocelin,"Apartment is as described on the listing, clean and cozy. It is a short walk to colosseum and main street.  Lorenzo was not around  to meet us but Mauro was very helpful with his directions and available on phone if we need help. We requested for extra pillow and fan and got it the day after. Bread and juices were prepared for us as well. Very pleased and will recommend this property to others wanting to stay near centre but quiet neighbourhood."
37054,69407448,2016-04-11,11693916,Roxanne,"We had a really lovely stay at Lorenzo's apartment. The location is really great - we walked everywhere (except to the vatican). It is very close to the Roman Forum and the Colosseum. And we found a lovely area with lots of restaurants (a gluten free one too) on Via del Boschetto and Via dei Serpenti. 
The apartment is very small (just one room with a sleeper couch, table and kitchenette) but it has everything you need and is very clean and modern with everything in working condition. The only things that were missing were a few kitchen appliances - there were no bowls or butter knives, and no kettle. However the kitchen is very small so maybe many people eat out everyday. 
Lorenzo was a lovely host - he met us early (as our flight came in very early) and showed us how to unfold the bed etc and gave us advice on getting around and to the vatican especially. He was always quick to respond as well if we had any queries. I would definitely recommend staying here - especially if you do not plan on cooking very much during your stay. The location is the best feature and that is worth everything. 
"
37054,70205157,2016-04-17,47925391,Paola,"La descripciÃ³n del anuncio es real, tal cual se ve, el departamento nos resultÃ³ cÃ³modo, el agua caliente es muy buena.  El barrio esta  bien ubicado, para poder recorrer a pie toda Roma.  Lorenzo fue un gran anfitriÃ³n, muy cÃ¡lido con su recibimiento, indicando lo necesario para poder manejarnos durante nuestra estadÃ­a. "
37054,71003969,2016-04-22,49785699,Solenn,"Nous sommes trÃ¨s contentes de notre sÃ©jour Ã  Rome grÃ¢ce Ã  l'appartement de Lorenzo qui est tres bien situÃ©! PrÃ¨s du colisee et de toutes les commoditÃ©s on a fait presque toutes nos visites uniquement a pieds. Le mÃ©tro est tres pratique, on l'a utilisÃ© pour se rendre au vatican."
37054,72014507,2016-04-30,30692143,Candy,"On our arrival we were welcomed by the host's friend as the host was unavailable.  We got hit with a late check in fee of 30 euros which was not mentioned (however guess we should have checked the house rules section of the ad). The apartment was very small, sofa bed took forever to put down.  The house rules are to be responsible for cleaning the apartment everyday, however the mop and sweep was located at the top of the door which was only accessible if you used the small step ladder, even then we couldn't reach as the things were pushed too far back for us to get a hold of.
The location was fantastic, very convenient to walk to anywhere in Rome. 
Overall the apartment was not really for us but would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in Rome just for a few days to just use the place for sleeping. "
37054,72614846,2016-05-03,55730957,Julie,"He was very kindly gave us right. Very close and the Coliseum was the location of accommodation and tourist sites There was no inconvenience to go to. To the showerbooth is a bit narrow, but washing did not deserve to be uncomfortable. Because of his home became much felt close to Rome. I recommend his house for you."
37054,73961888,2016-05-11,53800714,Ingrid,A very good flat for a couple and for a shorter stay in Rome. Perfect location!
37054,74448128,2016-05-15,29598253,Joe,"Lorenzo was a great host. he was quick with his responses and was very helpful with directions and etc. the aprtament was very clean as well. 
we chose this place because of the location and we were very happy with it. great proximity to all main sites. defenitly worth staying.
thank you!"
37054,76425352,2016-05-27,28462059,Amelie,"PER-FECT!

The studio was the perfect fit for our 4 days stay in Rome. Amazing location (the Roman Forum is like at the corner of the street, and highlighted each night! and Colisseum and Palatium are less than a 10 minutes away walking),  clean and VERY QUIET! You just feel good and safe in this appartment. 

Easy access from Termini station and a lot of buses around to drive you to the Vatican, the Trevi fountain, the Piazza Navona...

The only thing to know is that the kitchen is not very big, but anyway, you don't go to Rome to make your own pizzas! :)

Lorenzo was very nice, available et professional. 


"
37054,77353684,2016-05-31,3658857,Brad,"Lorenzo was very welcoming and able to meet us despite us not being able to have internet access and tell him our exact arrival time.  He was very helpful in giving us tips for good restaurants and things to do around the city.  There were crossaints and  coffee for breakfast.  The futon was comfortable.  This apartment is on a quiet street, but in a great location.  It's in a great neighborhood with lots of good restaurants and walking distance to all the sights and a metro station."
37054,78436862,2016-06-06,8827686,Dani,"Lorenzo was very friendly and helpful. Great communication, organised a pick up from the airport and was flexible about key times. "
37054,79195086,2016-06-11,62000400,Maegan,We loved our stay in Rome thanks to Lorenzo's location. The apartment was literally steps from the Roman ruins and within a 5 minute walk of the Colosseum. I also have to say thank you to Lorenzo for working with us when our plane was delayed. I would definitely recommend his apartment and would stay again. Grazie
37054,79647785,2016-06-13,59536320,Kevin,"Our stay at Anna Home was an ok experience; mostly due to it's great location. Otherwise, there were a few things of note:

- Although Lorenzo seemed well prepared for our visit (good communication leading up to the stay etc), unfortunately he was not in Rome at the time of our stay. There is nothing wrong with that - he has a life to live too - but the person or persons he chose to clean and prepare the apartment, as well as meet us for the keys etc, did NOT meet expectation. There was no one to meet us at the apartment when we arrived at the agreed upon time. After waiting for a while, we called the contact number provided and the person sounded surprised/annoyed that we were there waiting for him. After waiting nearly an hour for him to then arrive at the unit, we entered to find that it wasn't even cleaned or prepared yet since the last visitor. We had to leave for another 45 minutes so he could clean it, and even after all of this the unit did not feel or look very clean. (floors, sheets, comforter etc.)

All of these things were very frustrating as we arrived on a Saturday with plans to see the Vatican (it's closed Sunday, we left Monday) and were forced to rush over there because of the two hour hassle of ""checking in"" to the apartment.

We don't hold all of this against Lorenzo personally, but at the end of the day he is also responsible for the people he uses and the condition of the apartment. 

It's possible that issues such as cleanliness are rare for this apartment and specific to the situation, but we cannot recommend this apartment to our friends and will not stay again despite the fantastic location.

If you're in Rome for a short stay and proximity to historical sites is your primary criteria then maybe give this apartment a shot."
37054,80032107,2016-06-15,10121819,Sherry,"Thanks Lorenzo! The location was not only perfect, but the host was so nice as to welcome us and give us an overview of everything once we got there. He was readily available if we had any questions as well and even arranged a pickup and drop off taxi to and from the airport for us! The colosseum is literally just down the street and is so close to many other attractions! We had fun just walking around and enjoying all the new and beautiful sights of this ancient city. "
37054,80329774,2016-06-17,36350178,Elodie,"Lorenzo est un super hÃ´te. TrÃ¨s soucieux de notre bien Ãªtre.
Il rÃ©pondra Ã  toutes vos questions en cas de besoin.
Appartement trÃ¨s fonctionnel et surtout bien situÃ© !
A 2 pas du metro et du ColisÃ©e. Une situation parfaite pour un sÃ©jour tout simplement magnifique!

Encore un grand merci pour tout!

37054,80668186,2016-06-19,20694909,Erin,"Lorenzo is an excellent host, very well organized and the apartment is perfectly clean! He also helped organize a driver to pick us up from the airport which was a lovely service."
37054,81369633,2016-06-22,60870437,Bastian,"Alles perfekt verlaufen, Lorenzo war zur vereinbarten Uhrzeit vor der Wohnung und hat vorher sogar schriftlich angeboten eine Abholung vom Flughafen zu organisieren.
Die Wohnung ist klein, aber sauber und ausreichend fÃ¼r einen StÃ¤dtetrip. Die Lage ist einfach perfekt, unter 10 Minuten zu FuÃ bis zum Kolosseum und der Metro, unter 15 Minuten bis zum Fontana di Trevi.
Wirklich nur zu empfehlen."
37054,82117442,2016-06-26,4534672,Nellwyn,"A very convenient place to stay in Rome that is walking distance to the Colosseum. Our host was very friendly and was there to meet us on time. He even helped arrange a taxi for us for our departure. The room itself was as described. A bit run down for my liking; perhaps a little bit of renovation would make it better. The bathroom is very small and the shower is extremely small. I am of slim build and short and found it quite uncomfortable to take a shower. However, for the price and the location it's a good place to stay if you're only after somewhere to rest your head after a long day sightseeing.

Thanks Lorenzo! "
37054,82622242,2016-06-28,80517606,Alessandro,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
37054,82840343,2016-06-29,68355275,Chua,"Lorenzo is extremely prompt with his replies and very patient with answering all my questions. 
Before going to the apartment, I read a review from someone stating that the house wasn't ready, and they had to wait and on top of that, the person cleaning the house was rude. Lorenzo was not free to meet, but asked his friend, Mauro to meet us instead. I did have to go through the process of the house not cleaned before my arrival but it was not a problem because at least we were allowed to leave our luggages and enjoy the day. We had no problems with Mauro at all and he was so nice! Even Lorenzo asked him to get us an apology gift which wasn't necessary but was extremely thoughtful. 
His apartment is very clean and just nice for two people. The best thing about his place is how near colosseum is! Actually if anyone is up for it, they can walk from his apartment to everywhere - Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Colosseum, Vatican City, etc. 
I would recommend his place to everyone!"
37054,84979542,2016-07-10,53845916,Jillian,"So lovely! Lorenzo was flexible and welcoming, making check-in and check-out simple. The apartment was perfectly clean and included maps and recommendations around town - it's in a great neighborhood that's a quick walk away from most anything you'll want to see and do. A few of the restaurants recommended by Lorenzo became our favorites of the trip! Excellent experience, would love to visit again soon."
37054,85523451,2016-07-11,5451280,Han,"Wonderful stay, small but great location and very convenient for a weekend trip. Lorenzo was kind and helpful with our travel needs. No issues with coordination with host. Amazing a/c. "
37054,86864132,2016-07-17,28173145,Joanna,"My mother and I stayed here for three nights and loved it! The location is perfect. I have been to Rome before and stayed by the treve fountain which was lovely but very crowded and a bit noisy. The location of this place was just perfect. You can walk everywhere and the forum is right there but somehow there are less tourists and crowds that wander in the neighborhood by the apartment. We ate out in our neighborhood instead of the main attraction area and the food was much better and we were usually the only ones speaking English in the restaurants. They felt very authentic and local. I cannot say enough about this place. It is very safe, very quiet, and the air conditioner is really good (I was there in July). The place is small but we were just there to sleep so I can't see why you would need more space. Lorenzo was very helpful and kind. Thank you!"
37054,87654020,2016-07-21,83248510,Lea,"Both appartment and service are very good. Lorenzo, the host, answers emails very promptly and is very helpful when making reservations etc. The appartment is clean, well supplied, and offers a simple, yet lovely atmosphere. You really get Rome vibes :) The neighbourhood and appartment building are safe and quite, with sights and cafÃ©s in walking distance. Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay and definitely recommend this place! "
37054,89024874,2016-07-26,56895749,Lixuan,"Lorenzo is a really welcoming host and his English is great. I really appreciate the helpful information Lorenzo provided. The apartment is close to the main sights you must see in Rome and good restaurants. The apartment itself is also very clean and modern too. In conclusion, thumbs up!"

37054,90922616,2016-08-02,27433990,Nathan,Lorenzo was very friendly and helpful. He gave us tips and suggested places to visit during our stay. The apartment was clean and the A/C worked beautifully as it was 34+ degrees Celsius while we were in Rome. We were very grateful that Lorenzo helped organize a private car to pick us up and drop us off at the airport when we were leaving Rome. Thanks for everything Lorenzo!  
37054,91963655,2016-08-07,9721192,Sylvain," Lorenzo est trÃ¨s accessible, rÃ©ponds rapidement Ã  nos messages et est trÃ¨s arrangeant sur les horaires d'arrivÃ©e et de dÃ©part! 
Appartement trÃ¨s bien situÃ© pour visiter Rome! Nous avons pu tout faire Ã  pieds! Il est trÃ¨s propre et bien Ã©quipÃ©! Bien pour passer quelques jours dans la capitale!  Tout de mÃªme petit bÃ©mol sur la literie!

"
37054,94121920,2016-08-14,23267277,Miranda,"Lorenzo's apartment was in the perfect location for our short stay in Roma! Although we didn't get to meet Lorenzo, his friend met us and was very kind. It is about a 20 minute walk with luggage from the train station, but once you are there, the Roman forum is right at your doorstep. The Colosseum was within walking distance, and we got to the Vatican by bus quite easily. The apartment is on the smaller side, but has everything you need for a perfect trip, including an espresso maker! The bathroom was clean, and the bed was comfortable after our long day of touring the city. 

Thank you, Lorenzo! We highly recommend this perfect location!"
37054,95624984,2016-08-20,58565206,Susannah,"Lorenzo was very communicative with me from the moment I booked until the moment I checked out. The space was clean, simple and had everything I needed. I would recommend Lorenzo as a host and definetly stay again."
37054,97628022,2016-08-28,51090793,Charlie,"Needed a last minute, day before, reservation and Lorenzo was quick with his replies and went out the way to male sure the apartment was ready. 
The apartment itself is as the photos show - it's small with a kitchenette good enough for basic meals. However the location is fantastic for all the major sights and has everything it needs for a short stay in Rome. The air con is a bonus but the apartment was cool enough to barely need it.
Highly advise staying here if you're a keen sightseer on a budget."
37054,101335729,2016-09-12,64814862,Sophie,"Had the most amazing trip to Rome for a surprise for my boyfriends 21st birthday and lorenzos apartment was the most perfect location and place. It was walking distance to everything you want to see. It was about 5 minutes from the coliseum with beautiful surrounding neighbourhood with lovely restaurants and shops!
Lorenzo himself was so so helpful he pointed in all the right directions of where to go and how to get there and was always happy to answer my questions.
The apartment itself is perfect for a weekend getaway in Rome!! Lorenzo even left breakfast and drinks for us! Sofa bed was super comfy and easy to use, shower was lovely and had shampoo and soap provided! 
Overall DEFINITELY recommend lorenzos apartment for location and the apartment itself. Had the most lovely time and definitely 10/10. "
37054,103138716,2016-09-20,49355883,Carla,"Getting here was easy, and very close to Colosseum. The apartment has everything you need. Clean, cute and cozy. The building is in is beautiful and very clean. We loved our stay and our communication with Lorenzo was amazing. The bonus perks were the drinks and snacks when we arrived as well as Lorenzo setting up our departure transportation for us! Highly recommend it!"
37054,104538087,2016-09-27,296432,Rae,"Lorenzo was a great host, apartment is very clean, very small and basic, but has everything you need and location is superb... and bed surprisingly comfortable! "
37054,106373382,2016-10-05,5499506,Philippe,"Endroit idÃ©al pour visiter Rome . En plein cÅur du Monti, Ã  cÃ´tÃ© des forums impÃ©riaux, sur une petite rue tranquille, la localisation de l'appartement facilite grandement les visites ! Parfait pour un court sÃ©jour de deux ou trois nuits. Pour un plus long sÃ©jour, il faudrait un endroit avec une plus grande cuisine, si vous avez l'intention de cuisiner (come c'Ã©tait notre cas), car il manquait d'espace.
Lorenzo est disponible pour toutes demandes. Et est bien sympathique. "
37054,107521001,2016-10-10,77431267,Rita,"My husband and I had a short stay in Rome and had a fabulous time there. Lorenzo's studio is situated perfectly in the city centre and the Roman Forum & Colosseum are at your door step. It's also an easy walk to the train station, and other attractions. Restaurants and the shops are also close by. Although the studio is in the heart of the city it was very peaceful and quiet inside.
The studio was as described-cosy & clean. Basic breakfast supplies for a couple of days were also provided, which was quite handy. Sofa bed was comfy and easy to open and close too.
Communication was great with Lorenzo, always responding promptly.  The check-in process was easy and Lorenzo was a great host, patiently showing us on the map how to navigate the city. He had also offered booking us a private car from the airport, which we decided to take at the last minute, making our arrival very smooth.
We highly recommend this studio and will be staying there again if we get another chance to go back to Rome!"
37054,107771881,2016-10-12,69932766,Mary And Martin,Lorenzo is a professional host who was very friendly. Previous comments on Lorenzo would be consistant with our experience. The apartment is an inner city and  intimate apartment. But Lorenzo has utilised all space to provide a welcoming apartment! We were very impressed with the apartment. Temperature of the room was good. It coyld get warm but tgere is a very quiet airconditioner in tge room. The bathroom is compact but showering was no issue. Maybe if you were taller than 6ft it might cause an issue. The bed is a fold out type bed which is clearly seen in pictures. I would not let that put you off though as it was comfortable to sleep on.  It area is quiet and walkable to everything. I felt safe in the area. I would suggest going to small wine bars or local pizza places in the area rather than eating in the Rome city area. The apartment would suit a couple who know each other well and  who would be familar with inner city living. 
37054,108700410,2016-10-16,70041045,Linda,"Lorenzo was very friendly and helpful. He was waiting for us when we arrived and explained how everything worked. He was responsive and helpful. 
The location of this flat was excellent! We walked everywhere from there because it was close to train stations, cafes, tourist spots like The  colosseum, the Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, the Vittorio Emanuel monument,the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Spanish steps, the Tibre River, etc, etc are all close to this flat which makes it very convenient to experience Rome easily. 
The flat is small and I'd recommend it for no more than 2 people for stays a week or less. Overall this place is the perfect home base to explore Rome from. "
37054,109082237,2016-10-19,5802378,Andrew,"Lorenzo was da man, you feel me?! Would definitely stay here again if we decide to swing by Venice for a 2nd time. "
37054,110150490,2016-10-24,13655157,Anne,"Lorenzo's flat is perfectly located: walking distance from many locations, the neighborhoud is very nice ! You will find everything you need in Lorenzo flat. Lorenzo is a charming person, warm welcome. Only detail to be noticed is the bed which is not comfortable. Our stay in Rome was really great ! "
37054,110556920,2016-10-27,33188822,Eric,Great place to stay and live like a local! Close to everything within walking distance!
37054,111865195,2016-11-02,32338244,Marion,L'appartement est situÃ© Ã  5min du colisÃ© ce qui est vraiment bien par contre il est trÃ¨s petit et certains Ã©quipements mÃ©ritent des rÃ©parations. Lorenzo a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s sympathique Ã  notre arrivÃ©e.
37054,112014616,2016-11-03,97992619,Kori,We stayed here for 2 nights- the apartment is exactly as shown in the photos and in a great location. Walking distance to the train station (about 20 minutes) and to all the major sites (anywhere from 5-20 minutes). The furthest we walked was to the Vatican which was 40 minutes - very doable. Lorenzo was there for us when we arrived to show us the apartment and provide us with a map of the city. After staying in hotels/hostels it was actually nice to have a fold out couch as a bed and a dining table to have somewhere to sit! I highly recommend this apartment and will be staying here again if I ever make my way back to Rome! Thank you for everything Lorenzo 
37054,112733025,2016-11-07,64359334,Miranda,This place is super close to the colosseum and the roman forum. The apartment is small but has everything you need. We had a great time and would recommend it to anyone who wants the full touring experience. 
37054,120292164,2016-12-09,49785346,Jacqui,"Great location- walk to Trevi Fountain, Colosseum, The Forum - good restaurants - Blu Laundrette is helpful and will do your wash so that you don't waste time watching a machine."
37054,122382031,2016-12-23,100927636,Maud,"TrÃ¨s bon emplacement, quartier centrale et trÃ¨s agreable, plein de petit restaurants et cafÄs trÃ¨s sympa. Lorenzo est de tres bons conseils"
37054,124559469,2017-01-02,100758678,Roberta,"Lorenzo Ã¨ molto accogliente e ci ha dato tutte le informazioni necessarie per la vacanza. La casa Ã¨ piccola, ma per una coppia va benissimo. La posizione Ã¨ fantastica, a due passi dal Foro e dal Colosseo. Ideale per spostarsi a piedi per tutta Roma, le fermate della metro e del pullman facilmente raggiungibili. "
37054,131984189,2017-02-15,31712384,Edward,Incredible location !! 
37054,134393294,2017-02-27,58138617,Luigi,"L'appartamento e' veramente in centro quindi in una posizione ottima. Il palazzo Ã¨ nuovo e in buone condizioni. Unico problema sono le dimensioni veramente veramente ma veramente ridotte, anche l'arredamento non e' curato e il letto te lo devi fare da solo. Ah non si parla di un letto matrimoniale o di un divano letto comodo ma di due brandine piuttosto scomode. Abbiamo trovato cose per fare colazione ma la qualitÃ¡ non era invitante. Il ragazzo invece e' sempre stato super gentile e cortese. concludendo noi nell'insieme non siamo stati male ma tutto dipende da quali esigenze avete.. "
37054,134794582,2017-03-01,3192332,Jason,"Lorenzo's home is located on a beautiful, quiet street and is within walking distance to many of Centro Storico's monuments. It feels very classic Romano -- the building has an interior courtyard and a fontana is located at the end of the street above a set of stairs. The apartment itself is small, but includes everything you need -- a large bed, full bathroom, and reliable wifi. Lorenzo was very responsive to messages and made the check-in process simple. I would definitely stay here again -- highly recommended."
37054,136056142,2017-03-08,112442629,Kiwon,"The place is Tiny and functional. Perfect for a couple!! Close to all of the tourist spots except for the Vatican, which are a few metro stops away. Everything is within a 5 minutes walk. Clean and efficient, quiet at night! Would love to come again soon..."
37054,136544021,2017-03-11,111152091,Amanda,"This apartment was cozy. It was very small, but perfect location for two."
37054,137697125,2017-03-17,54615539,Justine,"Lorenzo was a great host. Met us on arrival & helped us figure out the city. Gave us recommendations on where to eat (which we went to all his recommendations & they were all delicious!) His place is the perfect size to rest and relax, and in the core that is close to everything. We walked everywhere, with the exception of taking the metro to Vatican City. Great stay!"
37054,138766055,2017-03-21,52999567,Tanja,Sehr netter Gastgeber! Wir haben auch nÃ¼tzliche Tipps fÃ¼r unseren Aufenthalt in Rom bekommen. Das Appartement liegt super zentral. Wir konnten alles zu FuÃ erkunden.
37054,139185076,2017-03-24,56562906,Jaana,"The best location youÂ´d dream of for getting to know all of the historical sites. A clean and cosy room, and a quiet neighbourhood: we simply loved it. Thank you so much, Lorenzo, for your friendly hospitality! Warm recommendations. "
37054,139984463,2017-03-27,105937977,Sindy,"Our stay at Lorenzo's was wonderful, it's a cute little flat, perfect for two people.  It was great walking distance to all main attractions in Rome.  When we return to Rome we would love to stay again. 
Thank you :) "
37054,140463184,2017-03-30,119282587,Anita,"Der Aufenthalt war sehr angenehm und die Lage ist wirklich perfekt. Man kommt Ã¼berall gut hin (gute Verkehrsanbindung) und zum Kolosseum sind es gerade mal 10 Minuten, wenn Ã¼berhaupt. 
Das Appartement ist klein, aber mit dem NÃ¶tigsten ausgestattet und ideal fÃ¼r ein StÃ¤dtetrip. Jederzeit gern wieder!"
37054,141678118,2017-04-04,103350317,Lauren,Lorenzo was so fantastic! He was super easy to communication with. The apartment had a fantastic location and was very nice and clean. The bed wasn't the most comfortable and the shower head had almost no pressure but that wouldn't stop us from staying here again!
37054,143084814,2017-04-10,35196277,Florence,"Appartement trÃ¨s bien Ã©quipÃ© , trÃ¨s bien placÃ© prÃ¨s des forums. PropriÃ©taire trÃ¨s sympathique et de bon conseil. "
37054,144624303,2017-04-16,54580732,Erik,"The appartment of Lorenzo is on a beautiful location. On the outside you can see a littlebit of the forum romano and with 5 minutes walk, you can see the colosseum. The appartment is a small studio with everything you need. It's in a building with a inner garden and multiple appartments. Lorenzo took a view sweet sandwiches for us and it have a little kitchenette for everybody who wants to cook. The bed is comfortable and there is a small bathroom. Also there is free wifi. Over all we had a great stay! Thank you Lorenzo! Greetings Erik and Melanie"
37054,145611347,2017-04-19,32611101,Ferdaus,"Lorenzo's apartment was in the perfect location- minutes from the Roman forum. Lorenzo was away when we stayed but he did ensure we had fruit juice, tea, coffee and milk which was appreciated. The apartment was smaller than I expected- more like a standard double room with an en suite. The kitchenette was useful- although you do need to think outside the box as there is a double hob only but no kettle, toaster or microwave- however, we managed fine.  There were plenty of towels, soap and shampoo and the kitchen was well equipped with cleaning products.
I stayed with my 12 year old daughter and it worked well for us. Lorenzo was so easy to communicate with, replying to messages promptly and was very helpful on all the questions I asked. We had a late departure flight and he very kindly allowed us to use the apartment up until we left for the airport. Thank you Leonardo for a lovely stay."
37054,146917051,2017-04-24,106607593,Jess,"Lorenzo was great, he met us early when we landed and had got to the apartment.
The apartment was in a great location, straight onto the Roman Forum, very central and easy to find.
Very disappointed with noise after hearing how quiet it had been in all past reviews. At hours late in the evening, and early in the mornings, 12pm at night and sometimes 2am or 4am in the morning, people talking loudly and smoking outside our window so we had to shut it.
The shower was either boiling hot or cold. 
It was such a shame after reading such amazing reviews and it being our first Airbnb experience.
I did not think it was worth the money and wouldn't stay here again unfortunately. "
37054,148672132,2017-05-01,65815557,Rebeca,Awesome location!!! We were within walking distance to the Colosseum and neighboring historic sites. Lorenzo was very informative during our check in and provided useful suggestions and how to get around the city the best. The map he gave us really came handy. He was a really nice host and made us feel welcome. 
37054,149809137,2017-05-06,102765431,Constanza,"Lorenzo es muy buen anfitriÃ³n, nos recibiÃ³ a horario, nos dio un mapa de Roma y nos remarcÃ³ las atracciones, pero eso no fue todo... nos ayudÃ³ a planear nuestros dÃ­as en Costa amalfitana, nos asesorÃ³ acerca de Ã©l servicio de trenes y alquiler de auto!
El departamento es tal cual se ve en las fotos del anuncio. Es limpio, super bien ubicado, estÃ¡bamos a una cuadra de los Foros de Cesar y Augusto... solo a 5 cuadras del coliseo... hicimos todos los puntos que nos interesaban caminando (excepto una vez que usamos el metro para ir al Vaticano que no es cerca).
Hay ascensor, y habÃ­a en la heladera Leche, jugo, agua, cosas para desayunar, etc.
Quedamos super conformes! 
Gracias por todo Lorenzo!"

37054,154770283,2017-05-26,85808534,Amanda,"Stayed here for a few days whilst exploring Rome. The place is perfectly central, only a few minutes walk away from the coleseum. Lots of fun areas around. Lorenzo was a great host. "
37054,156848176,2017-06-01,41106398,Francisca,"Excelente lugar! Hermoso los alrededores, caminar por ahÃ­ es estar en pleno Roma. Muy cerca del coliseo y de todos los destinos turÃ­sticos.

VolverÃ­a a quedarme ahÃ­ miles de veces! â¤ï¸"
37054,157471323,2017-06-04,84829924,Gina,"Die Wohnung liegt sehr zentral und dennoch ruhig  in einem wirklich sehr schÃ¶nen Viertel. Die Klimaanlage funktioniert einwandfrei. 
Eine kleine Oase der Ruhe mitten in Rom! Wunderbar. 
Sollte ich wieder nach Rom kommen wÃ¼rde ich genau diese Wohnung bei Lorenzo wieder buchen."
37054,158923194,2017-06-09,23950880,I,"This is a studio, not an apartment. Lorenzo is great at communicating and friendly and the place is centrally located, but the bed is very uncomfortable. No laundry in little room either."
37054,160398716,2017-06-14,64810595,Kate,"The key draw of the apartment was its location and it is very close to the Colosseum and Roman Forum and still within walking distance to the other mains sights in Rome. Lorenzo was very helpful and happy to answer our question upon our arrival. The apartment itself is small and quite basic but was perfect for what we needed and is on a quiet, cobbled street but still in the heart of Rome."
37054,160875070,2017-06-16,73738558,Sharon,"Lorenzo's place is literally down the street from one of the forums. The location is perfect for walking to most of He major tourist attractions. The apartment is tiny and if you have a lot of luggage, it might be a little bit cramped. We enjoyed the charm of staying in the heart of Rome in the big, very old building and living as a local resident. Lorenzo was very kind and very helpful to us."
37054,162456966,2017-06-21,51950698,David,Clean and well located. Great communication
37054,164054272,2017-06-26,118799315,LIlia,"I stayed at Lorenzo's flat for 4 days in June 2017 with my sister.  We were completely happy with everything. 
First, Lorenzo is a great host. He was very punctual, friendly and caring, communicated very quickly both before and during the visit. Arranged a transfer for us from and to the airport. When Lorenzo met us, he provided us with all the information we needed and some snacks and drinks, which was very nice. When we were leaving the check-out time was 10AM, but our transfer to the airport was at noon, so Lorenzo kindly offered us to stay in his other flat till that time. We appreciate this very much. 
Second, the flat's location is as good as it gets! I examined a lot of options before booking, and Lorenzo's flat attracted my attention by the very closeness to all main Rome great places. Everybody was exited about this, and it appeared to be that great! We could walk everywhere, even to Vatican! The flat is really in the very heart of Rome and still in a quiet and cosy neighbourhood.
The flat itself is quite decent and has everything a person may need during a stay.
I highly recommend this flat and consider it to be a very good option for the money."
37054,164637680,2017-06-28,113717174,Heba,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I'm so glad I had chosen Lorenzo's place. It was perfect. The location was beautiful and it was close to all the main attractions. His place is charming and offers a great experience for first timers in Rome. Lorenzo is a great host, patient, helpful and hospitable. 

Thank you Lorenzo. "
37054,165608490,2017-07-01,32882619,Nathan,"Lorenzo was very helpful and made everything easy. Apartment is in a great location, we could drop in during a day of sightseeing for a break"
37054,166636737,2017-07-04,110958848,Nicholas,"Lorenzo was a great host. Check-in was thorough and he went above and beyond with the extra time he spent giving us pointers for what to see, how best to get around and places to eat. 
Space was comfortable and clean.  We would definitely stay with Lorenzo again."
37054,169118147,2017-07-11,22159336,Jennifer,"Lorenzo was a fast communicator, though I never met him. His friend, Mauro was so nice as a host AND as the cleaner of a lot of Lorenzo's properties. Hope he gets a good amount of thanks and monetary support. Place was fine for 2 people, though I wouldn't recommend more. Small bathroom, couch bed takes up a majority of the studio. Wifi and air conditioning worked well. "
37054,170242691,2017-07-15,8182884,Stuart,"Lorenzo's place was as central as you can get. It's not a huge apartment but very workable for a couple and it has all the necessities - including great AC and WiFi. If you're in Rome to get out and about and are looking for a nice clean walkable home base you will be pleased.

Finally, Lorenzo was excellent and accommodated our travel issues - check in was smooth. "
37054,171368659,2017-07-17,12615001,Angela,"Great location in city center and close proximity to all the sights. Lorenzo was also very responsive. Could have been much cleaner though and amenities could have been a bit better (bed, bathroom and shower) but overall a positive experience."
37054,174566743,2017-07-26,38200640,Danny,Lorenzo's place is amazing! Located in a nice local area close the colosseum! The place itself got everything you need! We enjoyed staying at his home very much! Thank you 
37054,177201045,2017-08-02,24903251,Court,"The perfect place to see Rome!
Location is amazing for so many things to see and do. 
Super clean and tidy.  Cute and cozy place that has everything you need. The AC was a huge bonus with the crazy heat!
Highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to see Rome"
37054,183839186,2017-08-18,19915436,Marie,"Lorenzo was not home, but he was easy to get in contact with!  The apartment was small, but it was very nice and it was a great location! Extrodinary location!! 
We walked to every tourist places from the apparment and it was not far or difficult to find. 
We will deffently book the same place if we come back! Remember to go to the best restaurant in town called panne e salame, WOW good and chep (check it on TripAdvisor)
All the best to Lorenzo and the apartment."
37054,188686553,2017-08-30,71723727,Kelley,"Lorenzo's place is fantastically located in the city centre within walking distance to pretty much all of the main attractions - the only time we took the bus was to get to the Vatican. We also enjoyed many of the wonderful restaurants that are also within walking distance. The place is as described and is clean and highly functional. Lorenzo was very pleasant and was responsive in communicating with us throughout our stay. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to spend some time traveling like a tourist, but living like a local. We will be back here for sure! Thank you Lorenzo!"
37054,190838074,2017-09-05,132969124,Mascha,"Everything was fine! The appartement is small but there is everthing you need, directly in the center of Rome."
37054,191325882,2017-09-07,4841993,Carla,We loved it! Perfect for 2 who spend all day and most of the night out. The only thing we needed was an iron. Lorenzo answered all our questions and graciously let us store our bags early. We will definitely return and tell all of our friends !
37054,193044774,2017-09-12,672622,Nalini,"My husband and I loved staying here during our brief visit to Rome for 3 days. The location was ideal: right in the historic area and perfect for walking to restaurants, for sightseeing, or to catch public transportation. The apartment is small and well laid out with good lighting, an adequate kitchen with stovetop and refrigerator, overlooking a charming courtyard. It is safe as well: on a quiet lane inside a secure building. It is just right for a married couple or 2 close friends. Lorenzo was easy to communicate with and very hospitable. We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Rome."
37054,193593258,2017-09-14,87564429,Sophie,The location was fantastic and very easy to access the sites. The flat is small but fine for a night or two. It was very clean and Lorenzo made us feel very welcome. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it!
37054,194253590,2017-09-16,107204949,Sarah,"Lorenzo's place was great! Small apartment, but very clean and in an amazing location for exploring Rome on foot. Easy walk to the Forum and Colosseum. Lorenzo gave us great suggestions on food and even set up a taxi for us to go to the airport. Would definitely recommend staying here! "
37054,195368836,2017-09-19,5460047,Meredith,"Lorenzo's house was about a 10 minute cab from Roma Termini and a 3 minute walk to the Roman Forum. It was perfect for our stay, so close to everything - wonderful food, major attractions as well as the road less traveled, the metro, taxis - whatever youre looking for in the experience. We stayed for three days and four nights and would absolutely recommend others stay here as well! The building and neighborhood felt extremely safe, even when we were lost, and the air conditioning was a nice reprieve each day during the siesta. We highly recommend - Enjoy!"

I really recommend this apartment if you travel in Rome. 
Great location!!!!
Very kind host!!!"
37054,200941218,2017-10-07,108673880,Breno,Lorenzo was a very nice host. The apartment is closed of everything. For 2 people the apartment is excellent.
37054,201898220,2017-10-09,4996899,Alyssa,"Excellent location for seeing all the sites. Can walk to the Colisseum and other monuments (Pantheon, etc). Apartment is small but we barely spent any time there anyways! Lorenzo is lovely and gave us a map and some great info/tips on what to do. He was very accommodating and responded quickly to any questions. 
In regards to Rome, keep in mind Vatican museum and Basilica/mostly everything in Vatican City are closed on Sundays. Also prepare for lots and lots of tourists (even in October)."
37054,204893955,2017-10-20,58987918,Diane,"Bien que le condo soit trÃ¨s petit et qu'il manque d'espace de rangement, l'emplacement dans ce vieux quartier de Rome Ã©tait idÃ©al. Il est prÃ¨s du colisÃ©e et de beaucoups de sites anciens. Tout peut se faire Ã  pied. Nous avons passÃ© un merveilleux voyage. L'accueil de Lorenzo fut trÃ¨s chaleureuse et il est toujours prÃªt pour aider."
37054,205958014,2017-10-23,113660023,Neus,"Hemos disfrutado de una estancia maravillosa, la ubicaciÃ³n del apartamento es inmejorable, justo detrÃ¡s del Foros Imperial y a dos minutos del Coliseo. El barrio donde estÃ¡ ubicado es precioso, con ambiente alternativo, con gente joven pero tranquilo y muchos pequeÃ±os bares y restaurantes para comer o tomar algo a muy buen precio. 
El apartamento es algo pequeÃ±o, pero como estÃ¡bamos todo el dia visitando la ciudad, no necesitÃ¡bamos mÃ¡s. Lorenzo fue muy amable con nosotros, muy atento y ademÃ¡s nos hizo sugerencia de rutas por la ciudad, algo que nos fue muy Ãºtil."
37054,206776068,2017-10-27,61389668,Cynthia,Great apartment near the Colosseum!
37054,208765824,2017-11-03,54915261,Ethan,Lorenzoâs place was super convenient to everything in Rome! Great place to rest your head at night after a day of sight seeing. The only thing i would improve is the bed. One side was a little lopsided and firm. May just need a mattress topper or something! NBD.
37054,211543567,2017-11-13,59839671,Maximilian,Nice little apartment in a great location for all the tourist points and restaurants.
37054,212489299,2017-11-18,26541403,Kyle,"Lorenzoâs apartment could not have been more perfect for the trip we planned to Rome. From the location to his hospitality, everything was spot on and more importantly comfortable and accommodating. 

We were within a five minute walk from the Colosseum and within 15 minutes of most of the touristy attractions. 

However, the best part was receiving local insights from Lorenzo on where to eat within the neighborhood. We ate at a local trattoria and it was one of our favorite parts of the trip. The neighborhood was lively and fun. A town square is close to the apartment and offers a great local experience. 

He greeted us, highlighted locations and restaurants on a map and was available if we needed him for any thing else. The apartment, while small, was cozy and comfortable for the two of us. 

It was a truly great place to stay and Lorenzo was a wonderful host."
37054,213446069,2017-11-21,61500970,å½­,good apartment. very clean
37054,214026351,2017-11-24,147276261,Elizabeth,"This apartment is about 5 minutes away from the Colosseum and there is a ruin at the end of the street-it doesnât get more authentic than that. We loved the neighborhood and Lorenzo was extremely helpful and allowed us to extend check-out by one hour and helped us find a place to store our luggage. The apartment is small, but clean and is great for two people. We did sleep with the windows open and the apartment faces the interior courtyard which was a little loud with the birds and the neighbors yelling, but with the windows closed it may be quieter. Overall the stay was wonderful and I would highly recommend."
37054,215187669,2017-11-28,156579990,Moumita,Great place to stay.
37054,216704774,2017-12-05,160213005,Hannes,"We really enjoyed our stay at Lorenzos place. There are two things that I especially like to point out. First, the location. I mean, everything was in the walking distance, which we really enjoyed since we did not want to spend any time for transportation but rather wanted to walk everywhere.
Second, the quietness. That was almost unbelievable how quiet was the apartment during the day and especially during the night. We slept with open window and no sound from outside disturbed our sleep. Also, I was bit concerned with the bed, since my husband had had just recently back surgery. But the bed was just fine. Yes, I would definitely recommend Lorenzos place to others and go back myself."
37054,217833722,2017-12-10,17239401,Mathias,It was a nice stay. Monti is a great area and in walking distance to everything you would want to see.
37054,224488165,2018-01-03,40916618,Samantha,"Lorenzoâs place was close to everything! Itâs the perfect size for two people, especially because you donât spend much time in the room. Would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone! Lorenzo is a great host and responds quickly!"
37054,226011133,2018-01-08,115138323,Timna,Cute little apartement just 2 minutes from the forum romanum! Would definetly recommend and love to come back. Perfect location for our vacation in Rome.
37054,226538509,2018-01-11,165949969,Karina,"Great location, we could walk to all destinations!"
37054,228862644,2018-01-21,145061958,Coleman,Good location
37054,232548229,2018-02-05,170082624,Jonathan,"Pros:
- Location, very close to all the sites, I walked everywhere with no issue.
- very nice host and quick to respond to messages
- cozy feel , safe location
- nice heater ( I came in winter)

Cons:
- wifi was a bit spotty
- birds can be noisy at night 
- water pressure is low
- the kitchen sink and bathroom door were a bit fragile (but not a big issue)

Overall I had a good stay, I highly recommend this place as the location is awesome and perfect for a tourist wanting to explore the center."
37054,233566011,2018-02-10,66767368,Gerhard,"Great and quiet location in the very nice and hip âMontiâ neighborhood (Rione as itâs called in Rome ) , with many nice and non touristic restaurants for going out at night . Close to Piazza Venezia, the Quirinal, the Forum Romanum itâs really an ideal area to stay. The mini apartment is ideal for one but also for two people if the donât have  much luggage because there is not really much storage place. Itâs on the first floor with elevator. The pictures give a good impression though the flat is smaller in reality. Itâs quiet except sometimes for birds  during the night .  I guess they are the seagulls you see on the near Forum Romanum. You can walk from Termini railway station where you catch  the airport shuttle buses or (the more expensive ) Leonardo express train. Leonardo is perfect in communication ( also via (Hidden by Airbnb) ) . So a good deal for the asked price."
37054,235059248,2018-02-15,34801387,Nora,"Lorenzo was a lovely host, very kind and flexible. He gave us very good restaurant tips in Monti area. 

Lorenzoâs place was perfect! The location (Colosseum and forum romanum just around the corner!!). Just a 15 minutes walk from termini train station and easy to find. The apartment was perfect for two people: comfy bed and clean little bathroom."
37054,236438993,2018-02-19,63938228,Lisa,"Das Apartment ist sehr gut fÃ¼r einen kÃ¼rzeren Aufenthalt geeignet. Es ist sehr sauber und wirklich alles da, was man so braucht, sogar eine Espressokanne. Lorenzo ist sehr hilfsbereit,  absolut pÃ¼nktlich und verlÃ¤sslich. Die Lage ist sehr gut, neben den SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten, findet man schon 1 Minute entfernt das erste Restaurant. Das einzige, was wir Ã¤ndern wÃ¼rden, ist, die Schlafcouch gegen ein gutes Bett zu tauschen... FÃ¼r 1 oder 2 NÃ¤chte oder Leute mit weniger empfindlichem RÃ¼cken ist die Couch aber okay."
37054,237225532,2018-02-22,85047658,Arnaud,La situation de l'appartement  est excellente pour les visites  Ã  pied de Rome. Lors de notre sejour la douche Ã©tait  cassÃ©e et le canapÃ©  lit est trop vieux pour bien se reposer. Appartement  Ã  privilÃ©giÃ© pour un week end mais pas pour  rester plus de  deux nuits.
37054,243031649,2018-03-14,31145338,Dennis,"The flat is not big, but it has everything you need for a stay in Rome. It is located very near to roman forum and colosseum and especially the possibilities to visit all the highlights per feet is awesome."
37054,249515336,2018-04-02,17012943,Erin,Great location! Walkable from the train station and to anywhere you want to go to in Rome. Lorenzo is so knowledgeable about where places are you want to see and shows you where to go on a map. Perfect spot in Rome.
37054,250827029,2018-04-06,171353051,Kristy,"Tiny and clean, the location canât be beat.  At about 100 meters from the Forum in the Monti district, itâs a few blocks from great cafÃ©s and just out of the way enough to be very quiet.  Lorenzo is a great host who arranged a car for us from the airport. We might never have found its little side street, otherwise.  He keeps this apartment spotlessly clean.  The bed is a poor compromise of a sofa.  Not terribly comfortable, but still welcome at the end of a long day.  Everything in the apartment is small. The only place to sit and relax is the kitchen table.  This place is probably best for younger travelers.  Given the expensive nature of Rome, this is good value for money.  I'd come back."
37054,252369667,2018-04-10,8777270,Kathryn,We rented this apartment for the Rome Marathon as we wanted to be close to the finish line and the location could not have been more perfect. The space is absolutely perfect for 2 people; compact but with everything you need. Sofa bed was really comfy. Apartment building was seriously quiet considering the location and the amount of apartments in the building! Cannot beat the location. Would definitely stay again. Lorenzo was very punctual with replies and check in (we were even left some juice and milk which was a nice touch) - thanks Lorenzo!
37054,253423302,2018-04-14,44764923,Tom,"Super location, beautiful interiors. Very small flat, essentially a double bed and the toilet. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby."
37054,256949221,2018-04-24,9639462,Dianne,"A beautiful litle bolt hole in an outstanding position. Overlooked an internal courtyard so very quiet. Two people may find it a tight sqeeze but it was perfect for one. Lorenzo was a terrific host; punctual, helpful & efficient. It was my first foray into Air BnB & an impressive start."
37054,259659156,2018-05-01,175390940,Haylie,"We loved staying at Lorenzo's place. We felt very lucky we choose such a great apartment in such a great, fun area. The apartment is small but has everything you need. It was clean and tidy. Lorenzo was very helpful with local information etc. The local area has great restaurants, bars and gelato shops."

A menos de 100mts un mini mercado para comprar y con muy buena atenciÃ³n. Cercano a  Cavour donde hay varios restaurantes con variados precios. Lorenzo super atento."
37054,264597830,2018-05-14,173364007,Liz,"A melhor localizaÃ§Ã£o que podÃ­amos ter em Roma! Fizemos tudo a pÃ©, e quando voltÃ¡vamos pra casa, dava pra descansar bem, pois a vizinhanÃ§a Ã© bem tranquila!
Lorenzo sempre solicito, nos respondendo em questÃ£o de instantes.
Amamos e recomendamos."

37054,277766995,2018-06-17,117718574,Carolyn,A very central position. Quite small but adequate. Lorenzo was very accommodating and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 
37054,279945935,2018-06-22,24732857,Alyssa,"Could not have asked for a better place! It was perfect for our needs! Small but very comfortable and we didnât feel crowded at all. The location is unbeatable, we walked everywhere and Lorenzo is awesome (very accommodating)! We met some of the locals in this area and everyone was so kind to us. Highly recommend!"
37054,282458484,2018-06-27,38588307,K. Sati,"The location of this apartment is amazing - I lost my breath when we walked to the end of the block and right there were ancient Roman ruins - truly awe-inspiring. Lorenzo is very kind and met us at the apartment with helpful tips for sightseeing and meals. We liked the local and affordable""Madonna del Monti"" restaurant and the pizza place across the street. There's even a spa in the neighborhood that has sauna, jacuzzi and massage. The apartment is small - perfect for one/a little tight for two, and a solid, clean, no-frills space in a quiet building, and has air-con which was really nice. As others have mentioned, the bed could be better -  a little tilted at the ends, but the mattress was comfortable. Our only concern was a noticeable odor of mold in the kitchen area that hopefully can be remedied. Being able to safely open the windows was helpful. We had a fantastic time in Rome and would recommend this apartment with attention to the issue above. "
37054,288621085,2018-07-10,83558343,Saskia,"Lorenzos Apartement ist klein aber fein, wie man so schÃ¶n sagt. Die Lage ist unschlagbar! Wir konnten alle SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten zu FuÃ erreichen. Kolosseum, Forum Romanum sind praktisch direkt vor der HaustÃ¼r. Zum Trevi-Brunnen braucht man ca. 10 Minuten. - Perfekt! Ein groÃes Plus ist die Klimaanlage bei den sehr heiÃen Temperaturen in den Sommermonaten, wobei es in dem Apartement ohnehin nicht so heiÃ zu sein scheint. Personen Ã¼ber 1.85 m kÃ¶nnen in der Dusche leider nicht aufrecht stehen, aber wir konnten und arrangieren. ;) Die Gegend in der das Apartement liegt ist ruhig, vor dem Haus ist einer der vielen Trinkwasser-Brunnen, an denen man seine Flaschen stÃ¤ndig auffÃ¼llen kann. AuÃerdem finden sich viele Restaurants in der Umgebung. Wir hatten wirklich einen tollen Aufenthalt!"

37054,336480075,2018-10-14,108067937,Brad And Gabby,Excellent location right in the center of Rome. The space is a bit small but it worked out well as we spent the majority of the time exploring Romeâs many sights. Lorenzo was a great host who communicated with us well and provided great local tips.
37054,338698685,2018-10-20,151922546,Meredith,"Lorenzo's apartment was in the best possible location in Rome! It was right next to the Roman Forum (we could see it from the front door) and right down the road from the Colosseum.  The monti district was so much fun at night, all the locals will come out around the squares and drink and play music. It was very close to the bus stop to get to Vatican City. Lorenzo was wonderful and met us at his place early so we could drop our luggage off and gave us helpful tips around the area. He also has books and maps you can take around the city with you to learn more about Rome. I would definitely recommend this apartment if you want to be around all the action (it was very quiet at night also)!"
37054,340223362,2018-10-23,60319212,Sarrie,"Cute, nice, clean, safe, and overall the perfect choice to stay in Rome! Close to the attractions yet far enough away to get a great nights sleep and enjoy a little down time. Just enough space for a few people - my mom and I were cozy and felt as though we had everything we needed. Lorenzo is a great host and his space was such a pleasure."
37054,340787352,2018-10-25,199541415,Lesbia,"Very good location, clean, and comfortable"

Lorenzo es sÃºper amable y cordial, nos recibiÃ³ y nos explico las cosas correspondientes a la habitaciÃ³n pero tambiÃ©n nos recomendÃ³ lugares para comer. En cuanto al servicio, excelente, nos dejÃ³ preparadas cosas para desayunar, leche, tostadas, jugÃ³ y medialunas. No sÃ© puede pedir mÃ¡s!! Volveriamos sin dudarlo!"

Una cocina simple pero que sirve para cocinar, un sofÃ¡-cama super cÃ³modo y un sitio agradable para volver despuÃ©s de un dÃ­a de callejeo. Limpio y con todo lo que necesitas. Alrededor del apartamento hay supermercados y mercados para poder comprar y huir de lo mÃ¡s turÃ­stico. La comunicaciÃ³n con el dueÃ±o fue inmejorable, ayudÃ¡ndome en todo momento. Un sitio de 10."

Lorenzoâs place is perfectly central, only a 10 minute walk to the Colosseum, a few more to the Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps etc. The apartment is very warm and cozy and has everything you need for a fantastic stay. Thank you Lorenzo!"
37054,363648324,2018-12-29,201152775,Sean,Location location location! Close to basically every major sites and subway station. Place is very clean and warm. Small but have everything we needed.

37054,407509129,2019-02-02,31115192,Mary Anne,"The location was great, very close to the Colosseum. However, the space is quite small and the flat is a bit run-down. There is no bed, only a sleeper couch, and the sheets were old and did not stay attached to cushion of the sleeper couch. (The elastic was old and not effective so could not keep the sheets attached.) With the sleeper couch opened, there is little space to move around. Lorenzo was out of town, so his friend met me and let me in. He was helpful."
37054,410044959,2019-02-09,237211313,Brittany,Great distance from sites around Rome. Lorenzo is helpful with suggestions and information.
37054,417172021,2019-02-26,129944920,Diane,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!!  You will NOT find a better location, especially if this is your first trip to Roma, and you want to explore it on foot.  We walked everywhere...The Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish steps, The Pantheon, Circus Maximus and more. We were literally steps away from The Forum. The neighborhood seemed extremely safe and there were tons of restaurants right around the corner. We opted for Lorenzoâs driver to pick us up from the Airport. Even though our flight was about 30 minutes late, he was right there to pick us up and delivered us right to the front door where Lorenzo was there to meet us. Great response time to any messages, too. I strongly recommend Lorenzoâs place (just donât expect a lot of space)...who comes to Rome to sit in a room, though!!"
37054,419558628,2019-03-04,243463855,Vincent,"Super sÃ©jour Ã  Rome, l'appartement est trÃ¨s bien situÃ© et le quartier est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able.

37054,423442553,2019-03-14,26447753,Clementina,Lorenzoâs place was a great deal for the location. Central and walkable to all the main sights. And neighborhood felt very safe. Lorenzo was very communicative also which is a great plus.
37054,430983325,2019-03-31,65745368,Wallice,Really great location and good price for the area! Walking distance to all the major Roman attractions and shopping. Definitely the center of the tourist area so a bit harder to find really good food but if you go in side streets you can. The bed wasnât the most comfortable but still not bad itâs what Iâd expect. Clean place and an overall pleasant experience.
37054,432547260,2019-04-04,6920730,Niko,"Location was amazing, right next to the forum. Cute, comfortable space in the heart of the city."

37054,444504183,2019-04-28,239200043,Jesse,We enjoyed Lorenzo's place during our stay in Rome. It is about a 5 min walk to the Colosseum and very close to everything Rome has to offer. Will definitely stay here again if we ever come back!
37054,446326303,2019-05-01,26091680,Lisa,"Cosy, one bedroom appartement. Brilliant for discovering the city. Most of the sightseeing spots are within short(!) walking distance. Lorenzo is a really nice host, made us feel comfortable. We would definitely stay there again."
37054,447355209,2019-05-03,23783912,Dene,"The location was excellent for exploring the Colosseum and Roman Forum. Spectacular cobblestone streets and great little bars and restaurants nearby. The building is lovely too with a little courtyard to look into from the windows. It was quiet. We were met by Richard who gave us the key and information. The room itself is incredibly tiny, quite difficult for 2 people to unpack. Furnishings and amenities included very basic.  I found Lorenzo a minimalist communicator- more information on direction and best way to get there beforehand would have made a huge difference to us traveling after a long flight from the Southern Hemisphere never having been to Italy before and not speaking Italian. Pricing was quite high, but I did not check to see what the little hotels in the area were charging so cannot compare."
37054,450826082,2019-05-10,225643444,Arianna,"Lorenzo is very responsive and helpful through and through. Thank you so much for the restaurant recommendations! The apartment is in the center of everything, a short walk to the Colosseum and was very easy to find."
37054,451870759,2019-05-12,6044083,Charlotte,"The apartment is super well placed, 5 minutes walk away from the Roman Forum and a lot of cool restaurants around the place.
The place is clean and Lorenzo is very accomodating about in the arrival.
Only one negative point: very little hot water and pressure in the shower to wash.
I however strongly recommend this accommodation!"
37054,455024547,2019-05-19,70712082,Elora,"Great location! So close to the Colosseum and Forum! Lorenzo was super accommodating when we arrived early and allowed an early check in! So many great restaurants nearby, as well!"
37054,456715032,2019-05-22,63542615,Nolan,The Airbnb is in a very good location with everything close by and a 15 min walk to Roma termini it could really be an amazing stay unfortunately Lorenzo gave us no directions on to where to go to get to the place then to have him forget what our checkin time was while we were waiting outside for over an hour
37054,457429460,2019-05-24,195832362,GermÃ¡n,"Lorenzo is really helpful and his welcoming was excellent, good communication and he was really kind."

The only downfall was the pillows on the bed, fairly flat and the shower was a bit tricky to get the hot water to work. Lorenzo was very quick at responding to messages. Over great place to stay, definitely would stay there again!"

The air conditioning worked great and it was nice to come back to a cool apartment after exploring all day in the hot city. Great value!"
37054,473769511,2019-06-22,216089155,Julie,"This place is a fantastic location for all the sights. Literally around the corner from the Coliseum, Roman Forum, etc. you are in the heart of it all! The host was great, meeting us and tips on transportation. The apartment was very small. There is one futon folded out that takes up majority of the space and the tiniest kitchen Iâve ever seen. We were only there for two nights so we really didnât care too much - just needed a place to shower and sleep and it was fine. The ac was perfect and futon was quite comfy. The pillows really need to be upgraded. The bathroom was clean except the shower - which was tiny and not very clean with a very bad caulking job. Overall, if you think of this as a dorm room for 1 or a stretch for 2, it was fine."
37054,476873402,2019-06-27,266539442,Brittney,Location is spot on!! Really enjoyed are stay. Lorenzo is super nice and gave us recommendations on where to visit durning our stay! We also got a driver that picked us up and dropped us off at the airport which I really liked. You have to talk to Lorenzo to get that set up. But really enjoyed the room. Itâs small but itâs perfect for Rome because the only time we came back to the room was to cool off or to go to sleep! We were out exploring the rest of the time!
37054,480616105,2019-07-03,236169583,Sal,"Very nice space. Close and convenient to main attractions, food, etc. The air conditioning was much appreciated! We had an excellent time in Rome. Lorenzo was an excellent host!"
37054,484097959,2019-07-08,107193016,Amanda,"Lorenzoâs place was in the middle of everything you could possibly want to see in Rome!  The only place we took a bus to was Vatican City, but we probably could have walked there as well.  He set up a driver to pick us up from the airport, who gave us a map, circled where our apartment was and then highlighted all the most popular attractions.  That was very useful!  The air conditioner worked great and was so nice to come back to each evening as Rome is very hot this time of year.  Our only issue would probably be the pillows, we could have used a few extras for more comfort, but not a huge deal.  I would highly recommend Lorenzoâs place to anyone who is looking to be in the heart of all the major attractions in Rome!"
37054,485050635,2019-07-10,32780919,HeloÃ¡,"Lorenzoâs place was just as described. Great location. Close to the Colosseum, forum and lots of other attractions. Lorenzo was very responsive and accommodating with our check-in and checkout hours! The neighborhood is very lovely and there are lots of good restaurants and small shops nearby. I would definitely recommend his place."
37054,486105281,2019-07-12,30033712,Andy,"Apartment is very cozy. Perfect for those traveling in pairs. Studio setup with everything you need. The room was super clean and Lorenzo was great about checking us in and providing materials and recommendations on the local scene for restaurants, bars, tourist attractions, etc. However, I would say the best part of the apartment is the location. 8 minute walk from the Colosseum and most of the major attractions aren't further than a 15 or 20 minute walk. Also a ton of great places to eat and drink right there in the immediate area. Would definitely recommend but it may be a little small if you are traveling with more than 2 people. All in all, my girlfriend and I were in Rome for a couple of nights and thought it was perfect."
37054,489238804,2019-07-16,64374333,Fereshteh,"Great location; close to everything you need or want to visit. We even walked to Vatican, took less than half an hour! The apartment is very cozy and clean, Ideal for two people and exactly as described. I never had any problem regarding the communication with Lorenzo. He is very responsible and responses very quickly. He left some milk, juice and a basket of sweets for us which was very thoughtful. The air conditioner was really helpful because during our stay the weather was very hot. Highly recommended this place and will stay again. Thank you so much Lorenzo!"
37054,493905034,2019-07-23,108223427,Sherry,Place was very clean and bright. Location was great too! About a 15-20 minute walk to most tourist sights!
37054,499748456,2019-08-01,246370825,Breanna,Lorenzo is so helpful and friendly when it comes to check in and giving you ideas of what to do around Rome!
37054,504185817,2019-08-07,213601658,Hannah,"Lorenzoâs place is just as described! Itâs in an excellent location. Nothing was more than a 20 minute walk from the apartment except for Vactican City, which we used the metro to get to. If youâre from the US the cabs arenât too expensive either. The air conditioning was great considering it was in the 90s when we were there. All in all, a great place for 2!"
37054,507142578,2019-08-11,55284722,Bronwyn,"A neat, clean place to stay which is close to all the major attractions in Rome. Check in was easy and we were provided with tips and places to go. My only complaint was that the bed was just uncomfortable. Good value for money."
37054,515577717,2019-08-23,255612600,Nicole,Great location close to all the main attractions in Rome.
37054,526666136,2019-09-09,34790912,Firoza,"Lorenzo is a lovely host who made check in super easy. He took time to give us invaluable local tips and advice. His apartment is  neat, clean and so well located. There was ample of stuff in the pantry for us too. Monti the area is so trendy and special."
37054,528511349,2019-09-13,246461472,Jennifer,Location and  check in was great but the photos and description were misleading and not great for value.
37054,531277388,2019-09-17,94175329,Svenja,"The apartment is small but has everything you need for a short stay. The location is unbeatable. However, the apartment looks brighter on the pictures than it really is."
37054,532104206,2019-09-19,72746488,DesirÃ©e,Great location. Very close to the Colosseum. We fell in love with the Monti neighborhood. Was nice to relax there after a long day of touring. Lorenzo was very helpful and answered every question. So glad you were able to help us arrange a car service from the airport. Best decision!
37054,535294093,2019-09-24,92175443,Normand,Emplacement exceptionel. Tout etait parfait sauf le lit qui etait un futon donc incomfortable.
37054,537196849,2019-09-28,240205867,Conley,Great location
37054,538737704,2019-09-30,96971554,Alex,"This little apartment is perfect for a quick stopover in Rome, especially for anyone interested in checking out antiquity landmarks.  We were a quick walk from the Forum, Palatine Hill, Colosseum, and numerous other sites. The place was clean and Lorenzo was awesome with response times and flexibility in our arrival."
37054,539815227,2019-10-02,281828943,Aaron,Great location and nice host.
37054,541563849,2019-10-05,63245179,Megan,Lorenzoâs apartment may be small but it is in the perfect location for all things in Rome! We didnât have to take any busses because everything we did was within walking distance. Lorenzo is also a great host and is very responsive. My luggage got lost and we werenât available when it was delivered so Lorenzo met them and brought it inside for me. I definitely recommend this spot for anyone who is looking to spend time in Rome!
37054,542381452,2019-10-06,56858844,Dee,We stayed at 2 of Lorenzoâs properties in Rome in the Monti area. We could not had chosen a better location. He was extremely attentive and even arranged a driver to take us to and from the airport.
37054,544152733,2019-10-09,141517756,Iris,"The location is great, tourist sites are all in walkable distance and easy to locate bus stops. Place is small and very minimal. If it's just for sleeping, it's doable. Shower is a bit finkly..temperatures fluctuate while you are using, it was a bit frustrating. Other than that, Lorenzo was a good host with good recommendations and thorough communication."
37054,545425156,2019-10-12,63128316,Delia,The location is perfect! Everything you want to see in Rome is walking distance and it makes it perfect for coming back for quick breaks during the day. Lorenzo was very quick to respond to us whenever we reached out to him and even suggested some great eating places and transportation tips.
37054,550702979,2019-10-19,216778896,Bruna,"Amazing location. 5 minute walk to the Colosseo!!!
Even that Lorenzo was not the responsible for our checkin, he was always available on airbnb chat, which is very important in case you have any doubt about the city. Thank you for having us, Lorenzo."
37054,553138994,2019-10-23,289566344,Stefan,"Apartment is in a great location, walking distance from the major sites. The local area has a good selection of cafes and restaurants. Lorenzo was very quick to answer any questions we had. Would recommend!"

37054,588932957,2020-01-05,35003825,Chelsea,"Perfectly located, and one of the easiest check ins Iâve had in Italy so far. Lorenzo was very kind, polite and prompt. We would stay in this space again! 

As others have mentioned, the apartment size works for just one or two intimate people. Its best described as a small dorm room. With the perfect location though, you shouldnât be spending much time in the room anyway! 

Theres a wonderful bookstore up the street you should visit, and a great tattoo shop around the corner :)"

37305,17606371,2014-08-14,1184644,Samuel & Paolo For Firenze RentalsÂ®,Great apartment! Clean and great located! Carla is a super host and was very responsive and ready to help. I hoghly recommend this place. Don't think twice ... Just book!

La posizione Ã¨ comoda per gli spostamente e ben servita di ogni tipo di negozi. Grazie Carla per la super ospitalitÃ  e buon Natale"
37305,30955274,2015-04-29,3836670,Claudia,"We had a wonderful time in Rome at the Casa Pariolina, Carla is a lovely host. She is very charming and helpful, she provided us with a city map and great recommendations for food, drinks and sightseeing. We felt very well looked after :). The apartment is part of a stunning house and situated in a very nice neighbourhood just perfect for a city trip - in walking distance to all the sights but still outside the mass tourism crowds. We will be definitely coming back for our next trip to Rome!"
37305,33847397,2015-06-01,33246315,Emma,"Casa Pariolina's ""The Romantic"" was a perfect place for my boyfriend and I's short weekend in Roma. It's a good half an hour walk to all the sights but it's worth the lovely tranquility (if you know Roma, you know how insane it is during tourist season). Carla is a lovely host and is so warm and helpful! I definitely recommend staying here for a different taste of Roma."
37305,40261978,2015-07-29,23824290,Antonella,"Abbiamo soggiornato una sola notte nell'appartamento. La suite Ã¨ esattamente come descritta nelle immagini, curata e piacevole. L'edificio, molto bello, si trova in una delle zone residenziali di Roma, vicinissima a Villa Borghese, all'Auditorium Parco dela Musica e al MAXXI. Per arrivare in centro basta una piacevole passeggiata. Ben collegato anche da mezzi pubblici. La signora Carla Ã¨ stata una padrona di casa molto gentile, cordiale e disponibile. Grazie."
37305,48750378,2015-09-28,42498357,Sven,"It's a bit out of the city, but we'd come back here in a heartbeat! Carla was amazing, and the suite was perfect. Everything surpassed expectations!"

37305,72332560,2016-05-02,22661641,Teri,"I really enjoyed staying in this little apartment--it had everything you could need.  I have been to Rome many times but never stayed in this neighbourhood.  I will definitely stay in the Parioli from now on, it is beautiful, safe and convenient.  i'm sure I'll be sating at Carla's again as well."
37305,172626668,2017-07-21,37592243,Riccardo,L'alloggio Ã¨ esattamente come rappresentato in fotografia e descritto. La Signora CarlÃ  Ã¨ una Signora nel senso migliore e piÃ¹ nobile del termine.

The apartment is so clean, stylish and central to everywhere. Its located in the most classy areas in Rome, u can pick public transport in less than a minute walk.
Mrs Carla and Giorgio her son are marvelous, the apartment have everything u would need. Fast internet, security, modern utilities, privacy, classic view from the balcony, very understanding host, in fact to the point we ve become friends.
Definitely  would recommend the stay here without a single hesitation."

My wife had the opportunity of staying a couple of nights in this beautiful place, what about? Super clean, smells great, got everything you need in just few meters (kitchen, fridge, tv, even chocolates in the table, coffee machine) itâs a cozy place!! About the neighborhood itâs lovely and well located, close to many embassies, shops and thereâs a bio supermarket right at the corner. About owner attention? Mrs Carla gives you all indications you need, along with a map which in my case was quite useful. This is definitely a 5 star place. Highly recommended!"

Sia per la gentilezza con cui sono stata accolta da Carla e suo figlio Giorgio che per la casa,  confortevole,  pulita, funzionale e arredata con gusto.

The studio is snug and very well equipped; has a nice little balcony for your morning coffee. 
If you go to Rome during summer you will definitely benefit from the air conditioning in the room. 
Perfect for 2 people on a weekend away who want to avoid hustle and bustle of city centre while still being  able to walk to the main attractions - through the beautiful villa Borghese."
37307,45480793,2015-09-03,38940100,Daniela,"Ho soggiornato presso Casa Pariolina per una settimana con i miei due figli.
Il posto Ã¨  collegato al centro da un autobus proprio sulla strada e da altri a circa 200 metri - sul Viale Liegi -  ed abbiamo trovato un ambiente raffinato e dotato di ogni comfort, che ci ha veramente fatti sentire a casa! Grazie alla cura della signora Carla,  nell'appartamentino non mancava veramente nulla, dall'angolo cucinino fornito di ogni cosa ,all 'armadio con specchio,al phon, al sapone liquido di grande formato in doccia, agli ombrelli a disposizione degli ospiti e, particolari che ho molto apprezzato, pacchetti di fazzoletti di carta  e le deliziose gelatine di frutta e biscottini offerti dalla  casa, nonchÃ© una bella bottiglia  di acqua fresca in frigo all'arrivo!

Ideal for couples "
37307,72163055,2016-05-01,64644268,Jo,"Carla was a very friendly and charming host and took perfect care of us.
The apartment was small, but very nicely decorated, clean and tidy. The only remark to make is, that the gallery upstairs, where the bed is,  has a very low ceiling that does not allow for one to stand upright, unless you are not taller than 160cm.
If one is unfamiliar with Italy's tourism tax rules, it is worthwhile considering that there is a small tax per person per night. We were slightly surprised by this, but no big issue."
37307,73213002,2016-05-07,37243019,Amie,"Very pleasant stay, good location for proximity to the Villa Borghese and the LUISS university. Cute apartment with thoughtful supplies of beverages (coffee, tea, water etc) and light breakfast (yogurt, cereal). 

Host is very attentive and kind. Happy to give suggestions or provide assistance. 

Taller people might have a hard time with loft bed area (I am short so it was fine and really all you do is sleep  there). 

Also - cleaning is nearly daily - which is great, but cleaning person often moved my things making them hard to find sometimes (in fact I think I ended up leaving a book by accident)."

42829,2229200,2012-09-08,2944321,Kevin,stayed for a full week in early sept 2012. clean apartment in a very convenient location. we ate at the italian restaurant just right below it for 3-4 meals. cost about 25-30 euros per person (w/o wine) but ambience and food quality was very good. many other restaurants in vicinity too. as rome is a very walkable city this apt is situated in a great location to do that. the central train station is just 5 mins walk away as we used it to go Naples. slight problem were the apartment is a little noisy due to the cars u could hear outside. there is no aircon (just fan) so we had to leave windows open but  could hear the passing cars. i  think u may have this problem in half the apts on airbnb.  the host ms Rita / mr Fernando are helpful and try to please. 
42829,2344493,2012-09-19,3211036,Joseph,Simple clean space in a convenient location. 
42829,2541259,2012-10-08,1614611,Margee,"We (two couples) rented this apartment in early October, 2012.  It was a wonderful experience. 

The service was great from the very beginning.  M.  Rita was extremely reliable, answered every email in a timely manner and all our phone calls.  She was able to help us with a misunderstanding on my end  (first time renting on AirBnB) and made the process very clear.

The apartment is exactly as pictured.  Very clean, modern and the location is perfect.  It is directly across the street from the Opera House and the metro station.  The two bedrooms and bathrooms were perfect for four people with a ton of clothes/luggage.  We could have fit more people on the pull-out couch.  

The owner was welcoming, kind and ready to help us with whatever we needed.  The historic building was safe, beautiful and shared a lobby with a hotel.  They helped us with cabs to the airport, etc.  There was free WIFI (that really worked) and laundry available in the apartment.    

We have been to Rome a few times and this space was definitely better than a tiny cramped, expensive hotel.  It enabled us to spend time with our family while also having privacy.  Highly recommend it!  "
42829,3826431,2013-03-18,3526200,Dmitry,"Apartments in very good condition, superb location, good house. Host (Fernando) are very friendly and helpful, everything as expected. My best recommendation. "

42829,4715468,2013-05-21,4314661,James,"I always like to see the positive side in situations, so I will mention what my group liked about the apartment first. 

1) Location. This apartment is conveniently located close to many main attractions in Rome;  many of them within walking distance. Termini is the main train/bus stop in Rome and is a brief t mind the constant smell of smoke permeating the air you breath. So I would not recommend this place to my friends, even if they are smokers. "
42829,4966016,2013-06-04,6016205,Kurt,"Great location with elevator in building so you can walk or ride after a day of seeing the sights to the 2nd floor unit. Helpful and friendly host. A map to near-by grocery stores would have been nice upon arrival. Pharmacy, restaurants, and terminal station all very close. There used to be a grocery store (CARREFOUR) across the street which is now closed.  Check out the neighbor hood carefully, lots of wonderful surprises.  On our last day we found a market operating behind the building that had fruits, vegetables and a butcher selling wares."

Walk five minutes to take the subway, to the attractions is very convenient. A one bedroom apartment, more suitable for couples or a family of three living. Although not to see RITA, but her friend received us, very patient. Want to keep the phone open RITA oh"
42829,78409569,2016-06-06,16756362,Bec,"I loved my stay at this apartment! I didn't meet Rita herself, but the owner of the apartment, Fernando, greeted me upon arrival and showed me around the apartment. The apartment is perfectly located, close to all the major sights, shopping and restaurants. I would highly recommend this apartment and would happily stay here again next time I'm in Rome. "

El Sr. Fernando que es el dueÃ±o, resultÃ³ ser una persona amabilÃ­sima con quiÃ©n nos entendimos desde el primer dÃ­a y a quiÃ©n le hicimos sugerencias y las recibiÃ³ con consideraciÃ³n.
Es importante seÃ±alar que a la Anfitriona no la vimos y hablamos en ninguna ocasiÃ³n. Hasta dudamos de su existencia, recordando otros comentarios de huÃ©spedes anteriores.
Lo recomiendo al lugar porque es amplio y acogedor y con una ubicaciÃ³n perfecta.
A metros hay un restaurant que es muy reconocido en Roma, Matriciana, en el cual y desde hace unos aÃ±os saboreamos una excelente comida y atenciÃ³n, no es caro.
Estamos satisfechos y queremos reiterar la amabilidad de Fernando a quiÃ©n le hacemos llegar un fuerte abrazo. Que se cuide asÃ­ podemos visitarlo nuevamente.

42829,148750847,2017-05-01,91123414,Krishna,"The home was very clean and in a great location, but the description was a little misleading. It would not hold 6 people, there's only 1 bed and a pull our sofa, 1 bathroom, no dryer, and I did not see an A/C unit  (though i may be wrong) the shower takes patience to get the temp you want. Overall I would still highly  recommend this apartment for a couple. The host was friendly and always tried to help. It was extremely easy to walk to the sites. Everything was within 15 to 20 minutes except the Vatican which is 45ish minutes. There are also a lot of great places to eat within 5 minutes and a great massage parlor around the corner. You also get great saxophone music around 2100 but it is quiet by 2200."

The owner lives in the same suite (in a separate private apartment)  and is very accommodating.  He is friendly and wants to ensure you have a great stay in the apartment.  I would definitely stay here again!
42829,171926948,2017-07-19,60829829,Alan,"The apartment is central to all major attractions and we walked to most of them. 

Check in was easy as the owner lives in the same apartment-but segregated space. 

If you are a smoker then this place is ideal for you as so is the owner. Downside for non smokers is the smoke permeates the entire space. 

The apartment is not air conditioned this is only an issue depending on the time of year and your personal preference. The owner is very kind to place some fans for us. 

The two bedrooms are separated by a lockable door to the extreme small kitchen area. 

There is a washing machine which was great!  Just don't wash to much at once as the drying area won't hold much. 

The second bedroom and second bathroom open onto the shared main hall so make sure bring a bath robe. 

In all a pleasant stay once the temperature cooled down a bit."

Fernando, Ã¨ molto gentile ed ospitale, preciso, puntuale e disponibile per check in e check out. L'appartamento Ã¨ molto carino, io non ho usato la seconda camera che non mi serviva e quindi era di fatto composto da piccolo spazio cucina e una bella stanza comprensiva di divano/letto con spazio salottino e letto. tutto molto spazioso ed arioso. Visto che il clima non era piÃ¹ cosÃ¬ caldo non mi Ã¨ servito il ventilatore. La fornitura per la cucina Ã¨ piÃ¹ che sufficiente per piccoli soggiorni, c'Ã¨ anche la macchinetta Nespresso (sapendolo magari uno si puÃ² portare le capsule originali senza dover acquistare quelle compatibili come ho fatto io...). L'unico problema dell'appartamento Ã¨ il segnale wi-fi debole. Il sig. Fernando perÃ² ne Ã¨ consapevole e sta cercando di risolvere il problema. Assolutamente consigliabile."

What a unique place to stay, on an acreage property, but close to the rail (we drove to Saxa Rubra Station) which took us in to Rome in no time at all.  It was peaceful and our hostess was wonderful with ideas for sightseeing and thoughtful touches such as fresh fruit and a few necessities such as oil and condiments available in the kitchen.  We had all we needed and were very comfortable.  We had our own car which certainly made travel easier, but Sacrofano station would be walkable if necessary.  We would happily recommend the apartment and wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the facilities and the gardens surrounding the villa. "

My sister and her husband were the first to arrive and Giuseppe greeted them with a fridge full of groceries and a warm smile, despite having waited for them for hours because of my poor communication. I think the photo with the wall of shelves and mirrored wall might be from a different listing, but we didn't miss those features at all (see the airbnb verified photos for the real deal)! The bedrooms were quite big and we didn't feel cramped when cooking and eating dinner in the apartment. The location of the apartment was great: easy walks to the Pantheon (5 min), Colosseum (maybe 30 min, but great sights along the way), and Vatican (~10 min). We were really sad to be leaving the apartment at the end of our stay. "

The house was comfortable, but one of the photos posted for this place is incorrect, probably from another property (the one with the bookcases & mirrored wall).

44442,12739086,2014-05-10,164133,Nathan,"My parents and I stayed for 4 nights at Giuseppe's beautiful apartment next to Campo dei Fiori, and we LOVED it. Needless to say the location was excellent, but the apartment itself was great. It was spacious and airy so we had a lot of room to relax at the end of the day. The kitchen is cozy but well-equipped and we used it to cook dinner with food we bought just around the corner in the Campo dei Fiori market. For the art and history nerds (and let's face it, if you're coming to Rome you should be!) Giuseppe has a library--literally--of excellent books on every conceivable artist and historical site in Rome. We took a book of Michelangelo's sketches with us to the Vatican so when we saw the Sistine Ceiling we knew exactly how the artist conceived his work. There were also maps and guidebooks provided to us, as well as a guide to the neighborhood which Giuseppe himself wrote for us. The only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was that the two bedrooms face the street, so you might want to bring earplugs to soften the noise of the drunk people walking by late at night!"
44442,13237214,2014-05-23,11927616,Andrew,"Giuseppe's apartment was everything we hoped for during our 4 night stay in Rome. Great location in the heart of the old city, around  the corner from a daily fresh fruit and vegetable market, and literally surrounded by many restaurants and bars. The apartment was spacious, comfortable and extremely well equipped and Giuseppe welcomed us on our arrival with a wide range of local information. We very quickly felt like we were a part of the local neighbourhood, a very easy and authentic location  as a base for a tourist trip to Rome. "
44442,13507506,2014-05-29,13970322,Giao,"Campo dei Fiori apartment was quaint and lovely. Giuseppe was very helpful. We stayed there for 2 days and were very pleased with the accommodation. The area around campo dei fiori is beautiful, right in the centre of the city. We had dinner at da Sergio as per Giuseppe's recommendation. It's a family owned Italian restaurant across the street from the apartment. The food was great and reasonably priced. "
44442,13644366,2014-06-02,8125234,Saskia,"Die Wohnung war kleiner als sie auf den Bildern aussah aber in Ordnung. Die Lage ist grandios, direkt am Campo de Fiori, wo man morgens frisches Obst und GemÃ¼se fÃ¼rÂ´s FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck kaufen kann. Kurzer FuÃweg nach Trastevere, wo man super zu Abend essen kann.
Giuseppe war anfangs ganz nett aber bereits in der email Kommunikation etwas merkwÃ¼rdig. Auf meine Frage ""Wo holen wir den SchlÃ¼ssel ab"" Schrieb er ""am Appartment, wo sonst?!!?"". Auf meine Frage, wie wir dort am besten hinkommen schrieb er ""Mit einem Taxi, mit ein paar Bier weniger kann man sich das leisten..."". Wir fanden das schon irgendwie seltsam. In der Wohnung wurden wir verbal und mit Schildern auf alles hingewiesen, was man nicht darf- ist ja alles ok, aber den Tonfall ist entscheidend...
Beim Auschecken ist leider etwas schief gelaufen, nun soll uns der SchlÃ¼sseldienst in Rechnung gestellt werden... long story short: die Wohnung war gut, der Gastgeber nicht gastfreundlich (was sich besonders nun im Nachgang leider zeigt...)."
44442,13876692,2014-06-07,6247727,Swaroopa,"Giuseppe was a great host. He was very prompt and helped with the directions to the apartment. The apartment is located centrally and at walking distance to most of the attractions. Make sure to visit Campo dei fiori market which is a few minutes walk. The apartment had a great feel to it. We felt like we were staying at a typical old roman house. Giuseppe has great taste when it comes to interior decor and design. The apartment was sufficient for 6 people. The room on the loft was a highlight. Giuseppe was kind enough to call a taxi for us when we checked out. Overall, we had a great experience at the apartment and i would definitely recommend this place if you're traveling as a group."

We would absolutely book this property when we return to Rome"
44442,18224144,2014-08-24,11290313,Erika,"Thank you Giuseppe for letting us stay in your wonderful flat in Rome. Not only was it in an incredible position, it was so well appointed with pretty much every need anticipated & provided for! It was a lovely cool haven to escape back to after a hard day's sight seeing & we really loved the sense of actually living in Rome (if only for a few days). The best bit - going for a long walk every evening exploring the area... Grazie mille!!"
44442,19115820,2014-09-07,12636918,Marc,"Accueil courtois de Giuseppe dont on aime l'humour raffinÃ©! Bon connaisseur de Rome, son histoire et sa culture, il nous offre de bons conseils. Son appartement est extrÃªmement bien situÃ©. Nous avions tout l'espace nÃ©cessaire pour une famille de 5. Attention pour garer la voiture, on ne peut aller jusqu'Ã  l'appartement sans avoir un ticket car c'est une zone restreinte!"
44442,19452978,2014-09-13,9862109,Jon Jovi,"Giuseppe's flat was centrally located from all of the historical sites. Which was the main reason why we booked it. Campo de' fiori is literally right around the corner from this flat. The flat itself was great and was well accommodating for 6 adults. We hardly were in the flat but as what others mentioned great air conditioning and hot water. First night we tried doing away without the air conditioning and left the windows open while we slept. Bad idea as an unfriendly mosquito decided to pay us a visit in the night and gave us multiple mosquito bites. 

Giuseppe himself was very helpful, he appointed us to some great food on our first night, and even scheduled us a shuttle to and from the airport. Additionally, he was responsive in emails and phone calls. 

However, there was two instance where he did leave a lasting bad impression on us. First, he failed to communicate in advance to us that the tourist tax raised from 2 EUR to 3.5 EUR per person per night until we were checking in. In the ""House Rules"" section it still shows 2 EUR and not 3.5 EUR. So be mindful that it isn't 2 EUR but 3.5 EUR. Second, initially there was only 4 sheets and there was 6 of us total. The couple decided to share a sheet together but that left us with one more sheet needed. We searched the house and in the shelves of one of the rooms we ended up finding a comforter to use. On checkout day, Giuseppe showed up early to start cleaning the house for the next guests and upon coming into the room with the comforter. He became frustrated and demanded who used the comforter. In the end of that discussion we ended up having to pay a 10 EUR fee for a mistake on Giuseppe's end."
44442,19665826,2014-09-16,11313787,Karime,"La estancia en el apartamento fue agradable ya que contaba con aire acondicionado y estÃ¡ muy bien ubicado, cerca de piazza navona, los fines de semana es un poco ruidoso ya que en campo de fiori se reÃºnen muchos jÃ³venes y esto estÃ¡ a la vuelta del apartamento. La atenciÃ³n de Guissepe fue correcta trato de asesorarnos de quÃ© visitar en Roma, nos ayudo para solicitar un taxi. El wifi funciona muy bien.

Lo negativo es la tasa q hay q pagar por persona por noche, son 3.5 â¬ en lugar de 2â¬ como dice el anuncio y no se nos advirtiÃ³ de esto antes de la llegada, no habÃ­a suficientes sÃ¡banas en la cama, olvide unas mÃ¡scaras y le envÃ­e de inmediato un mensaje a Guissepe pero ya no me respondiÃ³, un amigo en Italia hizo favor de recogerlas y ponerse de acuerdo con el. En general nuestra estancia estuvo bien, otro punto el apartamento estÃ¡ n un primer piso y no cuenta con elevador."

Ev, haftanÄ±n her gÃ¼nÃ¼ meyve-sebze pazarÄ± kurulan Campo dei Fiori meydanÄ±na aÃ§Ä±lan bir sokakta. Lokalizasyonu Ã§ok merkezi. Heryere yÃ¼rÃ¼yerek gittik. Sadece havaalanÄ±na gidiÅ-geliÅte transfere ihtiyacÄ±mÄ±z oldu, onu da internet aracÄ±lÄ±ÄÄ± ile ayarladÄ±k. Ev aynen fotoÄraflarda gÃ¶rÃ¼ldÃ¼ÄÃ¼ gibi. Tarihin iÃ§inde yaÅamÄ±Å gibi hissettik kendimizi. 6 kiÅi idik ve rahat ettik. Sadece kiÅi sayÄ±mÄ±z fazla olduÄu ve bir WC olduÄu iÃ§in biraz sÄ±ra beklemek gerekti. Her odada klima ve kalorifer var. Åubat ayÄ±nda gittiÄimiz halde (Website hidden by Airbnb) arkadaÅlar olarak gittik ama Ã¶zellikle aile olarak kalmak iÃ§in ideal. 4 gece kaldÄ±k ve ekstra birÅeye ihtiyaÃ§ hissetmedik; lazÄ±m olabilecek herÅey mevcut ve temiz. Bu kadar iyi dÃ¼zenleme yaptÄ±ÄÄ± ve kibarlÄ±ÄÄ± iÃ§in Guiseppe'ye iÃ§in Ã§ok teÅekkÃ¼r ediyoruz.  Kesinlikle tavsiye ediyorum. Birkez daha Roma'ya gitsem yine aynÄ± yerde kalmak isterim :) 
Very nice and comfortable apartment. Location is very suitable for walking everywhere. Guiseppe is a very kind host. Thank you very much for his hospitality and smiling face."
44442,26905773,2015-02-22,4520239,Rachael,"I chose this apartment as it was in area of Rome that I know.  I was there in february with my daughters and the flat was lovely and warm with plenty of hot water.  It is very dark inside, which I 'm sure in the summer is great because it will  be cool and for us, as we only stayed four days, was also fine.  It's especially no problem if you're going to be out all day.  Giuseppe was friendly and checked how many rooms we wanted made up before we came however, he did charge 30 euro for late check in even though it was only 20.10, and I find that a little mean (especially on top of the Italian visitors fee).   The kitchen had everything necessary but is small - again that's fine if you're out all the time.  We had two meals in the flat and it was no problem to prepare.  The beds were extremely comfortable and it was difficult to make ourselves get out of them to do the site-seeing.  There is some noise from the little cobbled street as I think the market holders transport their goods along it from 5am but I quite liked listening to the noises in the early morning and it didn't really disturb us.  From having been in that area before I know it can be noisy.  I think it would be hard to find somewhere that's quiet in Rome!  All in all, I would go back."

The apartment was really nice. We were a group of four people and there was easily enough space for all of us. The location was perfect - located at Campo de Fiori, right in the middle of the historical city center which means that most of the attractions are in walking distance.

Giuseppe was the perfect host. Friendly, reliable and helpful.

Concluding the apartment as well as the host were absolutely lovely which is why I would recommend this apartment without any doubt to anyone who is visiting Rome.

Le jour de l'arrivÃ©e, il Ã©tait lÃ  pour nous accueillir et nous montrer l'appartement. Il a eu la gentillesse de nous appeler un taxi pour repartir avec un taxi ""officiel""."

44442,30857352,2015-04-28,1150610,Susana,Hemos estado un grupo de 6 amigas en casa Giuseppe. Nos ha encantado su casa. Al lado de Campo Fiore. Cerca de todo. El anfitriÃ³n muy amable. Se preocupo de llevarnos al supermercado y a la salida de pedirnos un taxi. El alojamiento perfecto. Ninguna queja. Muy recomendable
44442,31282167,2015-05-04,5405690,Ida,The apartment was as described and the location was wonderful. We had a great stay :-)
44442,32165705,2015-05-15,2220533,Debra,"Good location and authentic, comfortable stay. A bit noisy at night but happy with the accomodations. Giuseppe was also responsive in answering questions prior to our visit and providing helpful tourist info."
44442,32444197,2015-05-18,22027142,Norm,"The apartment was smaller than we expected, but it was safe, clean and in a great location so we didn't mind. The bedrooms are actually fairly large but the living room/loft and kitchen where small. The apartment came with all the amenities we needed including a stocked kitchen for cooking and air conditioning in each room.

Giuseppe was nice and was quick to offer his suggestions on where to eat and hang out. He also has his recommendations on sheets of paper   in the apartment sorted by region which was helpful."
44442,34050921,2015-06-04,2972496,Lelia,"pros: Location was great, safe and very fun. The apartment was nice and had nice style. Giuseppe was very nice and accommodating. 

The gym across the street plays lots of techno music during the day, which is a shame if you need a rest from the heat. The apartment was very dirty. The top glass floor was covered in hair and dust and the floor in general was dirty. There was mold in the shower and the washing machine didn't work well. We didn't get sheets for the top of the bed.

Overall, the lack of cleanliness made me feel like I overpaid :-/ "

44442,34617503,2015-06-10,18734565,Karen,"The apartment in Rome was very centrally located and roomy. There isn't a dryer but there is plenty of space to hang your clothes to dry. There is dish and dishwasher soap and hand soap in the bathroom but you will need to bring your own shampoo and bath soap. Because the apartment is so central, you can hear street noise at night, especially on the weekends. With earplugs, it is fine. It was roomy for 6 people except for the kitchen but as we mostly ate out, this wasn't a problem. It is a great location to go out walking at night. For a great day trip, go to Ostia Antiqua."
44442,35057895,2015-06-15,21914470,Jose,"Apart from an unfortunate situation where one of our guests broke a key, the stay at Giuseppe's flat was fantastic. He is a great host, and the flat is just as described. Ample space for our group of six, each room with its own air conditioning. I would definitely recommend to others. "
44442,36079345,2015-06-25,25043823,Steven,"Our family of 5 enjoyed our stay at Giuseppe's place.  We felt safe staying at the apartment.  It has a great location that is 15-20 minutes walking distance to most attractions (and literally around the corner from Campo dei Fiori).  As others have mentioned, there is a bar downstairs that can be noisy into the early morning hours on Friday and Saturday nights.  Outside of that, everything was terrific.

Giuseppe was a nice host.  He was kind enough to arrange a taxi from the airport.  We would stay here again. "
44442,36298510,2015-06-27,26118450,Marion,"Giuseppe Ã©tait lÃ  pour nous recevoir Ã  l'arrivÃ©e. L'appartement semble plus grand sur les photos mais il a du charme. La salle de bains est quelque peu vÃ©tuste.  C'est surtout le quartier qui nous a posÃ© problÃ¨me, avec un bar juste en bas, impossible de dormir malgrÃ© le double vitrage ! "
44442,36849732,2015-07-02,21725653,David,"Giuseppe picked us up at the train station.  He had a great deal of information about the apartment as well as suggestions for restaurants and activities.  He was very helpful.  The apartment was quite nice, roomy and very comfortable.  The location was fantastic.  Would definitely stay there again!"

The weather in Rome the weekend we stayed was extremely hot however the apartment was always cool without needing to use the air conditioners available. Guiseppe's was an informative host, we really appreciated his local knowledge. Would highly recommend. Janine (Australia)"
44442,38091565,2015-07-13,18188889,Lydia And Francisco,"We are a family with 4 children and stayed in this apartment the second week in July for 5 nights. We enjoyed Giuseppe's charming apartment. It had adequate room for us all. The location was very  good - in Rome's historic center  - just a block away from Campo di Fiori.  The location is ideal for seeing the major sights in Rome. One minor issue, however, is that there is an exercise gym across the street which played loud music during the evening hours.  We would recommend this apartment."
44442,42246488,2015-08-12,11356682,RÃ©gis,"We had a great weekend in Rome, the apartment is as advertised, very well located and close to all amenities.

Big ""master"" bedroom with comfy big bed and high ceilingsSecond bedroom has three single beds in it, perfect for our kids. Small kitchen and dining area but everything you need - as presumably in Rome you'll mainly be eating out!

Lots of info provided by Giuseppe. Good trip."
44442,45650177,2015-09-05,4864331,Ysabel,La casa era como en el anuncio y en las fotos.  La descripciÃ³n tambiÃ©n era correcta.  Giuseppe se pasÃ³ a conocernos en persona una maÃ±ana. 
44442,46264381,2015-09-09,12952008,Jessica,This was my first trip to Italy and using airbnb in which I do not regret my decision to book through this site. Giuseppe was very responsive and a very nice host giving us a map of the city and some suggestions on places to eat.  The entire apartment was how it looked and the location is great.
44442,49200825,2015-10-02,4929951,Mary,"Giuseppe met us at the airport and took us to the hotel which was great since we arrived only shortly before midnight.

The apartment is in a great location for all the sights of Rome. This is the second time we have stayed near the Campo and it great walking distance to everything.

The apartment is  very well-equipped with what we needed for our stay. It is very comfortable and contrary to previous review we found it very clean. and well-organized.

The only downside as mentioned by others is the noise. The gym across the street plays loud music for aerobics classes especially about 5-7 PM but during the day as well. The bar/restaurant 2 doors down has a clientele that stay out in the street and can be loud until 3 or 4 AM. Download a white noise app for your device and you will be fine.

We loved our stay depite this and Guiseppe was very responsive to us. Grazie Mille!

Everything in the apartment was on the right spot with friendly information and easy accessible: loved it.
Thanks, Giuseppe! "
44442,49873353,2015-10-07,1256047,Wanting,"We have 5 persons stay in Mr Giuseppe's apartment for 3 nights. Apartment is exactly what you see in the photos, with good location and easy access to sightseeing place in Rome. Mr Giuseppe is nice, promt reply the email and provide a lot of Rome information in the apartment for guest, it's very useful. When we arrive apartment is not ready but he arrange for us leave the luggage and come back later. And also arrange for airport pick up for one of our friend when she arrive at the evening. Thanks, Giuseppe!"
44442,50738753,2015-10-14,26505029,Geoffrey,"Far from being welcomed there was nobody at the property when we arrived.  We had emailed and sent an SMS that our train would arrive at Rome Termini at 14.06.  I telephoned Giuseppe when we arrived at the address but received only a recorded message.  It looked as though it might rain and we were all dehydrated so we went into a bar opposite and waited there until something happened.  Eventually more than an hour later a women arrived and let us into the apartment.  Far from welcoming us she was notable for her complete lack of charm.

We never saw or heard from Giuseppe and began to believe he as just a smiling brand name like Colonel Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

During the week I emailed him to provide us with a bath mat as the bathroom floor became slippery after we showered.  I never heard from him. Nobody contacted us about departure time and the contract said flexible.""""  I emailed Giuseppe and said we would be leaving at Midday. However cleaners turned up at 10:15am and pushed us out."

Ãven om det var turistpriser pÃ¥ barer och restauranger i kvarteren fanns det ocksÃ¥ en supermarket fÃ¶r ""vanligt folk"" alldeles om hÃ¶rnet. LÃ¤genheten var i ett fint gammalt hus, men smakfullt moderniserad med tvÃ¥ stora sovrum och ett sovloft med glasgolv. Giuseppe hade ocksÃ¥ en stor samling guidebÃ¶cker om Rom och Italien tillhanda."

No me parece bien. 
Lo enchufes hay que cambiarlos."

I tried to contact host for almost 2 hours via phone call as he prefers and then through text as a last resort with no answer, we had to wait outside in the street with our bags and luckily he showed up when it was convenient for him.

44442,56147015,2015-12-09,3738218,Tina,"Giuseppe is a very nice host. He provides maps/guides and is very happy to answer any questions. The apartment was clean, cozy, warm and just as in the pictures. The apartment is in a very central location. You can walk to any touristic attraction in Rome. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Giuseppe's apartment. The only problem was that the area was noisy in the evenings. But, I have to say that we are not night persons. :) Lastly, be careful that there is a per person per night tax expenditure that is not included in the total amount paid."
44442,57330890,2015-12-24,28034682,Disa,"Giuseppe welcomed me personally. He let us stay longer than we should have since our flight was at around 18h. The apartment was beautiful, exactly like in the picture. Giuseppe provided basic amenities; everything as it was said on the website. Thank you very much for being a nice and very helpful host, Giuseppe :) "
44442,57751701,2015-12-29,37781701,Andrew,"We had a great stay in Giuseppe's apartment which was a lovely home for our Christmas visit. It is well situated centrally in Rome and matches the photos and description well. Giuseppe communicated helpfully before our stay and let us know challenges with car access and parking (we left our car in a long term park at the airport and shuttled in which worked out well as everything in Rome was easily within walking distance and parking in the city would have been terrible). Giuseppe let us know before our stay that he would be away from Rome for his family Christmas, which was fine as we received a great welcome and introduction to the house from his friend Riccardo. Thanks Giuseppe!"
44442,59649515,2016-01-13,7945321,Tom,Excellent apartment! 1 minute walk from Campo de Fiori and pictures are exactly what you get. Giuseppe was waiting for us on our arrival and is extremely helpful. Would recommend! Thank you Giuseppe!
44442,60015874,2016-01-18,2866871,Miguel,Giuseppe os verte kind. The House fullfield our expectations. LocaciÃ³n excellent. Excellent experience. SÃºper recomiendes.
44442,60472137,2016-01-24,47010106,Brandon,"Giuseppe was an amazing host that from the moment we met till the moment we left showed exceptional hospitality. He took the time to walk us through the neighbourhood whilst telling us about its history. Knowing that we were interested in restaurants he put effort into pointing out numerous good eats as well as tourist traps to avoid. He also provided excellent communications, offered to get us grocery as we were coming in late, and also helped us organise a very comfortable shuttle service to the airport when we left (cheaper and better than taxi).

In regards to the apartment it was incredibly homey and exactly as you see it in the pictures. All the beds were clean and comfy, bathroom had a washing machine that worked fine, kitchen did its job, and the central location of this apartment made it perfect for Rome (7 to 10euro cab ride from Roma Termini not inc. baggage costs). We essentially could walk (max 30min) from the apartment to see the coliseum, the forum/palatine hill, trevi fountain, spanish steps, pantheon, trastavere, and we only decided to cab it out of laziness to vatican city.

The Campo Di Fiore neighbourhood was very lively by day with markets running in the square, a lovely shopping street exactly perpendicular to the apartment with awesome boutiques, and a pedestrian bridge 2min south of the apartment heading into Trastavere (where alot of good restaurants are). HOWEVER!!! This area is full of tourist traps so it is heavily advised that you use Trip Advisor or Yelp to check restaurants out, otherwise walk south to Trastavere where food is cheaper and generally better.

TLDR: 5/5 Apartment, 6/5 Host, would strongly recommend and would rebook."

44442,63895668,2016-02-28,45426183,Rogier,"We had a great stay at Campo de Fiori. Giuseppe helped us with advice on reservations and how to get to and from the apartment, as well as with tips on restaurants in the neighbourhood. The apartment itself is very complete and very well located in the heart of the city. All major highlights of Rome can be reached on foot or even by bike, with bike rentals around the corner. The photographs on the website describe the apartment quite well. "
44442,66140635,2016-03-20,42776153,Beverly,"Neighborhood was typically old European with small alleys rather than the wide streets we are used to. Close to local grocery stores, market and bus routes."

We really enjoyed our stay--overall great experience."
44442,68281205,2016-04-04,13425396,Laura,"Upsides: The location is amazing and the price is incredibly cheap.

Downsides: Giuseppe's listing says there is a washer/dryer. This was the one location we had a washer and dryer in our 4 locations in Italy, and when we got there he told us the dryer was broken. We decided to use the washer and air dry our clothes. The washer broke and would not open after we used it and Giuseppe charged us to fix it. This is an all ready broken machine that we ended up paying him 122 euros to get our clothes out of it. He also did not make one of the beds for us, which we needed for our party. "

44442,71584029,2016-04-26,30851024,Samuel David & Roxana,"The apartment's location is perfect! you are within walking distance to all the main attractions of the city. The constructions are medieval and the building itself is a landmark, constructed in the 1600's. The design is gorgeous, it takes advantage of the high ceilings and the architecture is beautiful. The pictures describe it well, but is even better in person. 
Giuseppe was warm and helpful. "
44442,73545147,2016-05-08,25951663,Lina,"Our stay at Giuseppe's place was excellent! The apartment was clean, spacious and with an authentic atmosphere given the location just off Campo de Fiori. We were a party of 5 women on a family trip and the location was key for us; walking distance to ALL major sites, points of interest and great food. The fact that Trastevere is just across the bridge is fantastic! There were some noise from the street in the night, but given all the walking we slept well anyway!
Giuseppe welcomed us personally with clear information on house rules and many tips on sites, shopping and restaurants. He even came back the next day with more information in line with our interests and an agreement to take us to the airport on the day of our departure. He made us feel welcomed and safe which really is nice when you are travelling with several generations in your party.
We all agreed in our party that we would return to this place any day. THANK YOU Giuseppe for helping making our Rome holiday fantastic!"
44442,78489398,2016-06-07,28425503,Avram,"The apartment  it was in very good location. 
MR. GIUSEPPE meet us I  the door. 
He was very kind explaining where to  go. 
THE apartment was very nice but I make a mistake no to mention the handle of the refrigerator was broken with a crack in the plastic it fall in the last day we never use it. 
(I recommend to make a walk through like when you rent a car) after we left Mr. Giuseppe send me a text to pay 100 euro to be fixed.  Of course I didn't pay for that it was not my fault. The bathroom have some black mold up on the wals and shower tiles. 
They come the day after to clean or put more coquing on top but the wals were the same.  I guess to much umidity but it was disgusting.  Mr Giuseppe try to help in sending some one to clean. 
I recommend to have a Profesional cleaners to do the job and clean the floor of the hole apartment. 
I didn't complain again because I try to pass it anyway we just went for sleeping. 
THE beads in the bedroom with 3 beeds are very uncountable I guess there are from ikea. 
In general was a good experience. 
And Mr Giuseppe was very kind."

Giuseppe was very accommodating for our group of six, offering rides to the airport as well as providing informational materials during our stay. We also left a few things behind and Giuseppe very kindly stayed in contact with us and made accommodations to mail them back to the states. I would highly recommend Giuseppe's place for a great stay in Rome! "

He showed us around the apartment and gave us some tips about eating out that night which were very helpful. He even took us to the local co-op supermarket on his way home! 
The apartment  has lots of character and is very central. There is ample air con with three units in total! 
We walked to the colluseum with ease and took the hop on hop off buses for anything else we wanted to see."
44442,87988684,2016-07-22,54223409,Louise,We just spent a wonderful 3 days in Rome in Giuseppe's condo. Location was great. Bedrooms were spacious and our 9 year old loved the sleeping loft. Cute kitchen. Suited our family of 4 perfectly. Giuseppe was there to let us in and provided lots of helpful information. We would stay here again.
44442,97707310,2016-08-28,31582078,Jane,"We booked Giuseppe's apartment for two nights in August. On arrival he showed us into a completely different apartment than the one advertised on Airbnb. When I pointed out to him that this was not the apartment we had booked he replied that the advertised apartment was too big for us and was not available then that workmen were in the apartment Utterly outrageous. 

I had been in touch with him in the days before our arrival and he failed to mention that there was any problem with the apartment that I had booked. My guess is that out of sheer greed he had double booked it.   

Had the apartment he was offering been as nice as the one we had booked we wouldn't have minded. But it was not. It was dark dingy dirty depressing and poorly equipped. No washing machine as advertised and no cutlery. The bathroom tiles were covered in mould. The door handle to one room came off in my hand as did the control for one of the showers. 

Clearly someone had been living there as the wardrobe doors were chained together and there were personal items visible. 

It was creepy and disgusting to put it mildly. 

We had no choice but to check in as we had nowhere else to go. Giuseppe simply failed to acknowledge that there was an issue and asserted that the apartment offered was nicer and more expensive. Had I not been so upset I would have laughed. 

During our stay we were yelled at by the elderly woman next door for hanging towels out to dry on the balcony.  The same charmless aggressive woman came into the apartment early on the final morning to clean and demanded that we remove our luggage, despite Giuseppe having agreed that we could check out at 5pm. 

I am an Airbnb host myself. This man is not fit to host guests in my opinion. Don't deal with him under any circumstances. 

Since our return to London I have reported the matter to Airbnb and demanded a refund which Giuseppe is contesting. This has prompted him to make rather wild spurious allegations, the first being that we left unspecified items in the bidet ( a hand towel in fact) and that as non Mediterraneans we do not know how to clean ourselves. Secondly he has alleged, two weeks after our departure, that we dropped candle wax on to a piece of furniture. He has the nerve to be demanding hundreds of Euros to restore this item. 

I see from previous reviews that he has done this before.

His place comes equipped with multiple guides on what to do while staying in Rome which made things very helpful! Definitely Recommended!
44442,100217554,2016-09-08,83839672,Rafael,G welcomed us when we arrived and made dining recommendations. The place is perfectly located. Our family of 4 really enjoyed the stay.

44442,132504019,2017-02-18,29844993,Florence,"Logement intÃ©ressant surtout pour son emplacement car prÃ¨s de toutes les curiositÃ©s de Rome (on peut tout faire Ã  pied avec une bonne paire de baskets). Le quartier de Trastevere, plein de charme, est tout proche, ce qui est vraiment agrÃ©able pour sortir le soir, plein de restaurants et de bonnes adresses pour boire un verre. 
InconvÃ©nients : l'appartement est sombre et bruyant et la salle de bain vieillotte mÃ©riterait un bon rafraichissement. Les lits sont confortables et la chambre parentale spacieuse. L'accueil de Guiseppe a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s amical.  Personne sympathique et Ã  l'Ã©coute et qui parle trÃ¨s bien le franÃ§ais. "

The compact apartment provides everything you need for a pleasant city trip: a good equipped kitchen, a hot shower, a decent bed and a atmospheric living room. A small remark could be that Giuseppe has a very nice CD collection, but no CD player. 
Giuseppe is a friendly host, who pointed us at a great restaurant that every unknowing passerby would skip. Highly recommended."

Very recommendable. Grazie! Christian and family from Copenhagen. "
44442,147323246,2017-04-26,15043351,Arnaud,Nice place to visit Rome. Walking distance from mainly all the visits specially close to Vatican. Giuseppe knows lot aboit Rome and will be keen to share. Also very good tratori close to the house.
44442,149608708,2017-05-05,103941345,Christoph,"Die Wohnung ist ein historisches Kleinod in einem sehr guten Zustand. Alles ist vorhanden, obwohl die zentrale Lage im Herzen Roms eigentlich keiner Selbstverpflegung bedarf.
Giuseppes Tipps bzgl. Restaurants und Bars waren absolut zutreffend. Wir empfehlen tÃ¤gliches FrÃ¼hstÃ¼cken bei Nonna Vincenza gleich ums Eck...absolut lecker sizilianisch!
Im Sergio schrÃ¤g gegenÃ¼ber gibt es eine tolle traditionelle, italienische KÃ¼che. Besser als die Restaurants an den Touristen-Hotspots. Das Restaurant Campo de' Fiori muss auch genannt werden.
Alle diese Empfehlungen von Giuseppe haben sich vollumfÃ¤nglich bestÃ¤tigt.
Wer von Rom historische Insider-Informationen erhalten will, hat mit Giuseppe ein wandelndes Lexikon als Gastgeber. Schon allein aus diesem Grund sollte man diese Wohnung wÃ¤hlen.
Vielen, vielen Dank!"
44442,154312570,2017-05-24,3408542,Tim,"The photos for this property are a little deceiving. The apartment is quite dark, even with all windows open. The living area is a small space with a small glass mezzanine above the dining area. The bathroom is a little mouldy and quite old. 

There's gym classes directly across the alley, and lessons start quite early with loud music and yelling, so not awesome if you want to sleep in past 7.30am. Also the apartment block is very noisy at night and we could hear the neighbours yelling to well past midnight. 

There are notes to the guests throughout the  apartment, with instructions in how to use the bathroom, temperamental washing machine etc... feels a bit like staying at your Nan's house. 

The location is quite good, a short walk across the river to Trastevere and to the markets etc... plenty of great bars and cafes around. "

The position of the property near Campo de Fiori is ideal, right in the middle of this fascinating part of Rome. We could walk to many of the places we wanted to visit. The apartment contains many interesting books about Rome which we were able to borrow and our host made helpful suggestions for places to eat. We enjoyed ourselves enormously."

44442,195434254,2017-09-19,35371720,Victor,My family and I enjoyed our stay here. The place is very nice. The communication started off on the wrong foot and we were charged extra for the host waiting around a few hours due to the host not seeing a message that was sent 2 hours prior to departure. Recommend calling host directly as he claimed he did not have a good data connection to check messages.
44442,199513270,2017-10-02,10178052,Hege,Perfect location close to every tourist attraction of Rome. The appartement was very clean and perfect for our little family. We loved everythimg about this place and can recomend it to everyone.

Pour le reste, un Carrefour express, situÃ© Ã  cÃ´tÃ© du campo et ouvert quotidiennement jusqu'Ã  minuit, a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s utile.

There is a very nice trattoria nearby full with locals and with good prices. Note that if you arrive/departure on Sunday, you will pay 30EUR additionally - we didn't notice that and were a little bit surprised."

Giuseppe a Ã©tÃ© tres reactif pour nous accueillir de la meilleure faÃ§on. Il est egalement situÃ© a cotÃ© du capo di fiori qui est tres centrale, pas loin du pantheon et a equidistance du vatican et le collisee. La vie du quartier est tres animÃ©e, mais comme lâimmeuble est situÃ© dAns une petite ruelle, on nâentend pas de bruit la nuit. Si vous avez lâopportunitÃ© dây loger, je ne peux que le recommander.

44442,229924576,2018-01-26,158028819,Shane,"The perfect local location, the apparent is located in a local area but is still so close to all the tourist hotspots. Giuseppe was very helpful offering advice about getting to the apartment from the airport, places to eat and everything in between. The apartment itself is amazing in every way the decor inside is beautiful and it's ability to accommodate 6 people is perfect. Everything you could think of was provided including towls, WiFi, helpful guidebooks and a kitchen with any required equipment. Giuseppe made our accommodation easy and took all of the stress out of the holiday."

44442,243279472,2018-03-15,107945039,Zaid,"My group and I were all very excited for our stay at Giuseppeâs Campo Dei Fiori location, but there were several things that left a very sour taste in our mouths. 

Prior to arrival in Rome, he had offered to pick us up at the airport which I thought was convenient and also very nice of him as cabs at the airport are sketchy. I had sent flight info and time only to have him show up at the wrong time. This was just a miscommunication but he had said he would come back at the actual time of arrival. Once we got there he was nowhere to be found and after finally getting ahold of him he told us to find our own way there. After many failed uner attempts and scammy taxi drivers we finally got a ride.

Upon arrival Giuseppe requested more money from us. A 3.50â¬/ tourist/day tourist fee which we actually anticipated, but also a 30â¬ fee for checking in late. Although this fee wouldâve been avoided if he had been there when he said he would to pick us up. On top of that he asked for a 100â¬ security deposit. We had just gotten to Rome and didnât have enough euro so he wanted us to walk to an ATM to get the money. He wouldnât leave until being paid, and even made a joke about sleeping with one of our female travelers, became frustrated and eventually yelled at us as well. He also promised to come back with a key as the second set had been broken by previous guests, but that never happened. 

There was another instance where we were checking out a room and I can back to Giuseppe taking my phone off the table and putting it in his pocket. I had to say a few times that that was my phone and eventually he acknowledged what he had done and âlaughedâ it off. I understand that Giuseppe is older and that this may have been an accident so I gave him the benefit of the doubt, however there was most definitely something about him that we didnât trust. 

The actual apartment was quaint. The best thing was the location and proximity to everything. It was clean for the most part but had black mold in the bathroom. Also there was only a comforter on the bed and the mattress protecter- no bed sheets. 

Rome was amazing, we canât wait to return but we will not be staying with Giuseppe again."
44442,247700820,2018-03-29,24273670,John,"Our group of five comfortably slept in Giuseppe's airbnb. The location was great. We were a 30 second walk from a beautiful farmers market, and a ~10 minute walk from the Pantheon. We did not cook while we were there but the kitchen was nice."
44442,250818917,2018-04-06,46568297,ValÃ©rie,"Appartement idÃ©al Ã  Rome. Lâemplacement est unique, Ã  deux pas du Campo de Fiori, lâun des plusieurs chouettes quartiers. Lâappartement est magnifique. Un immeuble ancien, un appartement aux trÃ¨s hauts plafonds en bois, Ã  la dÃ©coration rustique mais avec tout le confort nÃ©cessaire. Guiseppe est trÃ¨s accueillant et serviable et passionnÃ© par sa ville, riche en conseils. Adresse vivement recommandÃ©e."
44442,252853252,2018-04-12,49191388,Ananya,"We loved this place! This was our first stay in Italy, and it was perfect. The host was very accommodating and made sure that we were comfortable. The host also took the time to give us tips about local weather, eateries and attractions. The apartment was clean and spacious and very centrally located (close to the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and Spanish Steps). We would definitely stay here again."
44442,254604581,2018-04-17,39568015,Bjarne Gram,"Giuseppeâs lejlighed er perfekt for et besÃ¸g i Rom. Beliggenheden er fantastisk i et meget charmerende kvarter tÃ¦t pÃ¥ alt. Lejligheden indeholder alt hvad man har brug for, og Giuseppe er en meget venlig og hjÃ¦lpsom mand. Kan varmt anbefales."
44442,260223134,2018-05-04,64356239,Alice,Giuseppe did everything in his power to make our visit to Rome wonderful. He was a joy to work with. He has lots of maps and guidebooks available and good suggestions for out of the way things to see. Location is wonderful.
44442,261820104,2018-05-07,37489324,Petra,"Het appartement ademt nostalgie uit en zit op een superlocatie! We (5 volwassenen) hebben het er heerlijk naar onze zin gehad. Je zit echt dichtbij allerlei hoogtepunten. Realiseer je wel dat het een authentiek oud appartement is. Wij vinden dat mooi en leuk, maar je moet er wel van houden. Twee kleine minpuntjes, maar wel goed om te weten voor de mensen die gevoelig zijn voor prikkels. Wij werden soms wakker van het geluid van de andere bewoners via de binnenplaats en de badkamer kan niet goed luchten en ruikt bij intensief gebruik."
44442,266119960,2018-05-19,6527006,Laura,"Il posto eâ nel centro, molto comodo, ma la casa non eâ molto curata. Leti comodi."
44442,266457130,2018-05-20,2652442,Rosanna,Giuseppeâs apartment is in a fantastic location just a short walk from the main sights and Trastevere for the evening. The decor is really cool with beautifully ornate ceilings. Giuseppe very kindly met one of our group earlier than expected and communication was great throughout. There are some extra charges for a short stay so make sure you read the âother notesâ in the description. I would highly recommend staying here

44442,282383310,2018-06-27,158498153,Trent,"Great location close (15 minute walk) to most of the major attractions and an easy 5 minute walk to a variety of bus stops accessing Romeâs public transit. 

Giuseppe was there to meet us and was very helpful in getting us acquainted with the neighborhood. His sightseeing tips were also helpful. Giuseppe remained in contact with us to ensure we had everything we needed.  The flat was roomy, had all the comforts, and worked well for our family of six. I would definitely stay here again."
44442,284327906,2018-07-01,140641753,Carrie,Giuseppe is a great host and his apartment is very comfortable and in a great location!  I highly recommend staying here for your stay in Rome!

44442,295212977,2018-07-23,39381912,Sue,"Great central location, so closed to everything, major sites, great eating in the Piazza and lovely shopping with a fresh market close by .  Taxi stands within good walking distance. 
The flat was lovely and exactly what we had expected...perfect and comfortable for travellers and resting after a long day of site seeing.  We would definitely recommend his flat to anyone visiting Rome and canât wait to return! "
44442,300827610,2018-08-03,154196903,Casey,"Great location, great value, we lost our original Rome apartment due to an unfortunate mishap, but were so thankful that we were able to rent this apartment at the last minute, and check in within 2 hours of when we booked. Giuseppe never answered any of our texts, but he was there when we got to the apartment and we checked in. 

The 500 year old building was beautiful, but make sure you close the shutters in the bathroom-the mirror has a weird angle where it can be seen from the outside."
44442,314071881,2018-08-26,110478641,Regina,Die Unterkunft ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und hat unseren Erwartungen voll entsprochen. Die Lage ist fantastisch und es gibt aus unserer Sicht nichts auszusetzen. Absolut empfehlenswert!

44442,325632976,2018-09-20,177507515,Ben,"The location of the apartment is excellent and within easy walking distance of everything you could wants from markets, to restaurants to all of the main sights - we didnât need public transport at all apart from getting from the airport (c.45 min taxi) . The apartment made a great base for a group of 6 friends due to the bed arrangements. Whilst clean and comfortable, the flat slightly lacks natural light but this is fine as youâll be out exploring Rome and wonât want to be sat indoors! The only other real drawback is a lack of seating space for six people (just one sofa) but again, hopefully youâll be out and wonât want to be sat indoors! Value for money was great and check in hassle free. Would recommend as a comfortable base from which to explore the city for a few days."

Die Wohnung ist etwas kleiner als bildlich dargestellt, jedoch gemÃ¼tlich und rÃ¤umlich durchdacht. Wir wÃ¼rden Sie jederzeit wieder einem Hotel vorziehen. Von der Buchung bis zur Ãbergabe und RÃ¼ckgabe hat alles super geklappt. Danke auch an Aziz, der fÃ¼r Fragen immer bereit stand."
44442,333331026,2018-10-07,119765807,Allison,"Place was in a central location to visit the Vatican and Colosseum. Host offered tips on local places to visit and was a pleasure to meet. Beds were a little too firm for my taste but for a group of 5, we were happy to find a spacious place with AC that could accommodate us all."
44442,338701261,2018-10-20,2528722,Anssi,"An apartment full of history in an excellent location. High rooms and ancient wooden ceilings were impressive. Prepare for some compromises in modern comfort: windows are small and itâs quite dark even with lights on (could be good in hot summertime), kitchen is very compact and furniture is quite worn. The glass floor loft is quite a clever solution for additional space!"

44442,349805734,2018-11-18,133677827,Pilar,"The location of this appartment is perfect!, I was thinking to stay in the heart of Trastere and finally I choosed GiuseppeÂ´s place. It was a great decision you can walk to every single point of Rome (old city). Piazza di Campo di Fiori is one min to walk, there you can find a very nice athmosphere during the day and also in the night.  The appartment is very clean, we were 6 people, and every of us became a bed ! :)
The appartment is full of interesting books and guides of Rome that you can take for your visit.... very recommendable !

44442,350735479,2018-11-20,111724325,Ann,Beautiful classic apartment in heart of old city. Host indicated that it was formerly his residence and it certainly exuded the warmth of home. Clean and comfortable. Fantastic location on a quiet via steps from Campo de Fiore.
44442,353035645,2018-11-26,45329742,Olivia,"the location r Giuseppe's place is perfect for exploring Rome, very central and close to lots of sights and great restaurants. 
Giuseppe met us when we arrived which was great. We did however get charged for some additional fees e.g. a late check in which he hadn't mentioned before.
he was also  slow at times with response. overall though we had a great stay and I would recommend"

44442,362330179,2018-12-26,31689193,Gina,"Location is perfect for exploring Roma.  You are basically centered between the Vatican and the Colosseum (30 minute walk to either) and still very close to Trevi, Piazza Navona, Trastevere.  Each morning we bought a fresh squeezed juice at the market and had wonderful pastries from the bakery on the piazza.  The market can be bustling but it is a different feel from the Spanish Steps/Trevi/ Pantheon area where you are always being approached by people wanting to sell you something.  Campo Di Fiori makes you feel like you are living with the locals.  Wonderful restaurants and a grocery store nearby as well.  The location was perfect for our family of 5 and the apartment was perfect as well."

Guiseppe met us at the apartment for check-in and nicely welcomed us. He explained things to us and gave us good recommendations. We particularly enjoyed the recommendation to visit the remains of the Roman aqueduct. Guiseppe responded well to questions or issues we had."

Host did respond quickly but were informed that issue could not be addressed until following day.  We had traveled since 4AM, family of six, some had waited until Rome to take shower, was not possible for us to wait.  Also concern re: cleanliness in general but especially given fact there had been no hot water.  Requested release to find alternate accommodations.  Host would only offer comp of one night but would not accept releasing us from stay.    Location is great but otherwise a bad experience.

The WiFi was solid throughout the stay (we were there 12 days), and the bedrooms a generous size to unwind in after a long day of touring the sites. 

The kitchen and bathroom could use a good scrubbing. If you donât need pristine, this is good value for your money.  Also, please read the check in policy and do your best to follow it to a T."

Would highly recommend for people on business or tourist trips to Rome."
44442,604077378,2020-02-10,323491247,Jordan,"Massively disappointed..

We booked with Hanen (although messaged and greeted by Giuseppe) for a two night stay in Rome. Our group (6 of us) arrived at different times throughout the day, but my boyfriend and I arrived much earlier and Giuseppe agreed to let us check in at 8:30am (much earlier than the time listed, so we were very happy).

Upon our arrival, Giuseppe was not at the apartment and between messaging him and then calling him, he finally arrived about 10 minutes after us. We ended up having to pay 132 euros for city taxes, early check-in, and for staying less than 3 nights (10 euros per person). 132 euros seems a bit ridiculous of a price upon check-in and we have never paid that high of a price before, but we paid it anyways because we happened to have the cash on us and weâre flustered from the early morning traveling. 

Prior to our arrival, Giuseppe did not provide any check-in details other than what time to meet at. He also did not provide any check-out details when we were checking-in. Giuseppe was not overly welcoming, which I did not think much of until he began to get frustrated with us for small things during our conversation.... he wanted to know what time we would all be leaving on our last day, and I didnât know what time each of our group membersâ trains were at. While I was trying to figure it out with my boyfriend, Giuseppe became short and snappy with us, so we just said 11am as most of our Airbnbâs have a check out time of that. 

I messaged Giuseppe later that evening regarding a âdamage depositâ that was listed in the house rules, and since we paid over 130 euros, I assumed 100 of those were part of a damage deposit, because the 132 seemed a bit high. He did not respond to any of my messages throughout our stay, nor any of the messages I sent after our reservation ended for almost a week. After not hearing from him for several days, I sent a funds request for the deposit and sent him a message letting him know that I had been talking with Airbnb to clear this up. He finally responded and sent a rather rude and upsetting series of messages that look similar to his responses on several guestsâ reviews (look at any of the reviews with any criticism). 

Instead of understanding where my frustration was coming from for being ignored about money issues for almost a week, he was rude and unapologetic for such a delayed response. He did acknowledge my comment about the stains on the towels and how they sometimes get washed with different colored laundry, but yellow and brown streak stains on towels do not come from mixing colored laundry...... 

I did apologize to him for mixing up the damage deposit and the 132 euros I paid him (apparently they donât coincide so I will not be getting any money back). I also explained to him that if he had responded to my messages much earlier (like during our stay), I would not have had to reach out to Airbnb and it would have cleared up the situation. But the severe lack of communication is alarming to me - I have had Airbnb hosts respond a day or two late, but almost never DURING our stay at their place nor almost a week after. And never with such a an attitude.

A few more things:
1. The bed in the master bedroom had white stains on it as well and smelled as though someone had just slept in the bed. It smelled of body odor prior to us even using the bed. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were insanely thin, but in the scheme of things, that was the least of our concerns.
2. There were no check-in or check-out instructions prior to our visit. When we did check in, he did not leave any instructions for check out or even tell us that we had to check out in person apparently? I messaged him during our stay to let him know that our group would be leaving at different times on the last day and that the last couple may still be there at 10, even though we had told him 11 (which was just a time estimate as we did not know any one elseâs train times). He did not respond for almost a week and when he did, he did not even acknowledge our message about this and instead got mad that there was no one there at 11, when I had told him there would not be.
3. We are currently on a 5-week trip throughout Europe and visiting many different countries and cities - this stay has by far been our most disappointing. While the location was great, the value of our reservation lowered significantly because of the dirty towels, sheets and floors (dirty feet right after showering) and severe lack of communication. If something had happened that we needed an urgent response during our stay, I feel as though we wouldnât have gotten any response since none of my other messages were acknowledged until much later when we had gone.

The lack of communication is very unprofessional for an Airbnb host. I read almost all of the reviews for this apartment, and it seems like Giuseppe was very responsive and helpful to some other guests, so Iâm not sure why he was unable to answer any of my messages or questions. It also appeared that several other people experienced what we experienced. Iâve stayed in many Airbnbâs over the last 2 months, and have never been this unsatisfied. I had much better experiences at places that were smaller, places further from the main areas in town, and some places that were very out-dated, but this was because they were all clean and the host was welcoming and responsive."
44442,606220863,2020-02-16,143042697,Peter,"Lovely, and special, apartment near Campo de fiori - lovely market in center of ancient Rome. And quite good restaurants in the area as well. Also close to  river Tiber and Trastevere on the other side.
Good and precise communication with our friendly host - who also inspired us to visiting Galleria Borghese, as our knowledge of the famous Italian sculptor and architect, Bernini, needed a serious brush up ;-)
We will be back"
44442,609090262,2020-02-22,20647443,Paul,The apartment is close to the major attractions and is well situated in the Campo dei Firori. Close to many restaurants and shops. The hosts were very responsive and informative. The building is older but that added to the exprience. The bathroom is updated (no issue with hot water) and it does have enough beds for a larger group. We were there in February and the entire experience was great.
44442,612187919,2020-02-29,61686010,Jeremy,"This place was fantastic from start to finish. The owner met us at the apartment at the requested time, showed us the place, and departed. The place was spacious, amenities plentiful and the location fantastic. 

We were so pleased with the space that was offered. Plenty of space for our family of 5 to enjoy their own space, and come and go as we please. Could not be happier. 

Honestly, I am not sure what the previous reviewer had issues with as the city taxes are required by law and their information is clearly listed on their listing. 

Know that the city tax is 3.50â¬ per person per night. The issue is with the Rome not with the people owning this apartment. 

Stay here - you wonât regret it."

47149,287068,2011-05-29,51465,Karen,"I can't review Simona as the instructions on how to get to her apartment were so incorrect and incomplete that I found myself spending 3.5hrs of traveling around Rome trying to find her place with heavy luggage. 

The conversation on the phone I had with her during that night to get clarification did not help and she was completely dismissive of my predicament.

The many local railway guards and various locals I asked for help were as confused as I by the instructions she had sent me. 

Finally at midnight as the train stations closing for the night, and being a woman alone in a city I am not familair with I was left with no other option - I had to find an alternative accommodation choice at  addedexpense to me.

A truly disappointing and exhausting situation and the first FAIL and WORST experience I've ever had on Airbnb, which otherwise has been brilliant. Yet I still had to pay...

Simona's place looks lovely in the pics and I'm sure she's a nice woman but do ensure you understand she doe NOT live anywhere near the main station (Termini) and check the instructions as the Station name she gives is NOT on the main Metro line - In fact still have no idea where it is.

Good luck is all I can say..."
47149,305461,2011-06-09,580520,Dwight,"My wife and I (retired professors) spent 8 nights with Simona in early June and we had a wonderful experience. She is a very charming, caring person who did everything she could to make our visit to her house enjoyable. We had a light breakfast every morning in her small kitchen/breakfast room and she greeted us when we came home with offers of water or coffee. The connections to get the keys were very easy. Simona answers her phone promptly and was there to answer when we rang her buzzer, even though we were an hour early. In our e-mails prior to traveling, Simona provided clear instructions on how to reach her apartment, and following those we arrived by train in a station just across the street from her address. With a little homework using the map the AIRBNB provides with the confirmation e-mail, I was able to pinpoint her apartment and even was able to find a street-view. I will say, though, that the one person I asked (just to see if I had the right idea) at the airport really had no idea how to get to her house, so let me just give some simple directions: From Fiumicino Airport take the slow train toward Termini (i.e. the one that is NOT nonstop). At the Roma Trastevere station (about 5 or 6 stops) change to the train going to Cesano (I think on Binario 6-it should go in the opposite direction from the train from Fiumicino that you just got off) and go ONE stop to Quattro Venti and you will be within a block of Simona's house. This does entail a downstairs and upstairs to change platforms. If the stairs are a problem for you, take a taxi. They know where her address is. In pinpointing Simona's apartment it becomes clear that it is NOT near Termini. In fact it is in Trastevere, across the river from much of Rome, but on the same side as St Peters and only one stop away by the same train above. This location was not a detriment for us. We had no trouble getting to and from the heart of Rome using the number 8 trolley from Piazza Argentina. It will take you to the end of Quattro Venti, and then it is a 5 minute walk to the apartment. There is also an easy connection to the subway system. We bought a weekly pass, and once it is stamped, you never have to worry about stamping it again (for one week, that is). I would recommend this to any traveler, otherwise you must have a separate ticket for every trip. The apartment is in a neighborhood with a grocery store, pharmacy, pizza places and a bar that was open late for our daily evening purchase of sparking water which we kept cold in Simona's refrigerator. There is also a great gelato place about two blocks away-up a little hill. Trastevere is an interesting place in its own right. It..."

(1) The location: Located in Trastevere next to Quattro Venti station, the apartment is easily reachable from the ancient city center of Rome by public transportation. From Fiumicino as well as from Termini you have to change trains only once (definitely check out how to get to Quattro Venti in advance - in general, the signage on the subway/trains in Rome is a nightmare). Very easy to find, once you get off the train at the right station, even without smart phone, GPS and (Hidden by Airbnb) maps. Nevertheless I recommend you to walk there from old Trastevere at least once in order to see the less-touristic residential parts of Rome. By the way the area looked safe to me even at night. 
(2) The apartment: Beautiful furniture, as shown on the pictures. Most important for me - my room was very clean and I had my own bathroom, fast Internet, my own keys so that I could come and go whenever I wanted. Exactly like at home. I have to say that I definitely preferred Simonaâs apartment over the four-star Sheraton Golf Parco De Medici hotel where I spent some nights the week before. 
(3) The host: Simona is such a lovely person, very passionate about being a host and having people around her. She made me a nice breakfast in the morning with an ultra-strong coffee from her little Bialetti coffee maker (I loved it). Want to do sightseeing? No problem, Simona creates an individual tour for you and draws it in your map. Need a restaurant? Simona gives you recommendations â she even reserved a table for me and my friends, told me what is best on the menu, etc. On my last day Simona took me to the Gianicolo with her Smart where I had a wonderful view over the rooftops of Rome.
Thanks for your hospitality, Simona. It was a great first experience on airbnb. Iâll definitely come again and bring my family next time. "
47149,1435139,2012-06-07,536470,Aires Zulian,"Simona was extremely quick to respond and helpful from the moment that I sent the first inquiry about her place. Within minutes all of my doubts were clarified and I decided to stay at her place with my girlfriend for a romantic few days in Rome.

From the train station we took a bus to her apartment (conveniently located to a train station, tram and bus lines) and arrived in about 35 minutes. She greeted us with a warm heart, gave us a huge map of the city with clear instructions on how to get around and how to prioritize our visits during our short stay. Her apartment is beautiful and located in one of the best neighborhoods in Rome, far from tourist traps. 

We found a hard time leaving her house every morning because we had such wonderful conversations with Simona on all kinds of topics.  Every day she would make reservations for us in the best trattorias and restaurants in the city.

I will definitely stay with Simona next time i return to Rome as i will also recommend her to friends who want a true Romano experience in the  eternal city."
47149,1482999,2012-06-14,2605753,Chiara,Simona was great! Very sweet and accommodating. Grazie per tutto!
47149,1532027,2012-06-21,2424443,Erin,"My husband and I stayed at Simonaâs for 4 days in June. Simona is a generous and passionate host, and we had a very comfortable stay in Rome. Her apartment is gorgeous and absolutely spotless. Simona is enthusiastic about sharing what Roma has to offer with her guests, and she happily created itineraries each day along with bus numbers and directions. Simonaâs place is outside of the city center, but once we figured out the public transportation system, it became easy to get to and from the apartment via train, tram, and bus. 

If you are arriving in Rome via train (Roma Termini), you might find the tip below helpful: When you walk out of the train station into the bus station, just go to the information desk to ask where to take bus 75 (it took us a while to figure it out). Once on the bus, ask the bus driver to let you know when you are at Carini. There are 2 stops on Via Carini, and you need to get off at the second one: Carini (Pilo). Simona told us to get out at âPiazza Rosolino Piloâ, which is the second Carini stop, but the stop is not actually called this, and some bus drivers didnât know what we were talking about... Once you get out at the stop, go down the massive hill (youâll see what I mean. Itâs called Via Giovagnoli), and turn left onto Via Quattro Venti, and find her building number. "
47149,1558398,2012-06-25,2518270,Alberto,"Me and my girlfriend just spent a weekend of vacation in Rome as guest of Simona. 
Simona is a very kind person, her house is beautiful and comfortable, in a nice and strategic position.
We enjoyed our time spent talking with her.

47149,1726992,2012-07-16,2537657,Mel,"I had a wonderful stay at Simona's! she is a funny, caring and interesting host whom I loved spending time with.  The room is lovely and has a huge beautiful en-suite - a real luxury.  The house is gorgeous and in a lovely area.  I got a taxi which was reasonably cheap but such a spectacular drive its worth paying a bit extra just to see the sights on the way.  Simona puts on a great breakfast which temped even me (I'm not a big breakfast eater) and she was happy to help with all those travelling extras like booking tickets, calling restaurants and providing advice.  Wish I had a longer stay with her and would definitely recommend as a host.  Hoping to stay in touch! xx"
47149,2256170,2012-09-10,2238641,Mike,"It was wonderful to stay in this clean, friendly, brilliantly located apartment with Simona who is a generous and caring host.

The main points:

- the location is excellent for getting to every part of Rome (especially the Vatican), but more importantly for me the area itself is a beautiful and interesting place to spend time. You can easily go by foot and explore the charming, less touristy parts of Trastevere and really soak up Roman life. 

- Simona provides a tasty, generous breakfast, and she even cooked me a delicious carbonara (as a thank you, because I agreed to take the smaller bedroom without ensuite as she had some friends - an elderly couple - who had asked if they could stay in order to attend a hospital appointment)

- the apartment was immaculately clean, and the bed very comfortable

- it's a little noisy (it's on a busy road and the walls between bedrooms are thin), but only a problem if you want to take a siesta during the day, not difficult to sleep at night

- don't take a taxi from the airport it costs 48 Euros! It's so easy (and only 8 Euros) to take the train to Trastevere and then change on to the train to Quattro Venti - a 2 minute walk from Simona's apartment 

Thank you Simona for an excellent four days in Rome! I really enjoyed meeting you and Federico as well. See you again! "
47149,2297494,2012-09-15,2696955,Yan,"very very beautiful room, Simona's apartment is like one of the rome museum, worth to see. and she is very nice and helpful both for accommodation and travelling, enjoy the time staying with her. very good price for such a pretty room, only 3 min train to the centre:) nice location, safe and clean. definitely worth to stay"
47149,2474084,2012-10-01,3551341,Mahmoud,"
This was a great place to stay and Simona was a  very accommodating and helpful host, she gave me all of the info I needed to discover Rome.
The apartment is very verrrrrrrrrrry clean, comfortable, beautifully decorated, well furnished and is in a wonderful location. 
The apartment just 2 min walk from the Quatra vent station. 
All in all Simona B&B is offers very good value for money.

47149,2628490,2012-10-16,2850272,Susan,"Greetings to all Rome travelers!  This was my first experience with Airbnb AND my first travels to Italy/Europe!  So with that said, I can not say enough positive about my stay with Simona in her lovely ""La bella Italia a casa""!!  Prior to my arrival, I was able to easily navigate the 2 trains needed to reach her home......very easy trip from Fiumicino Airport, transfer at Trastevere Station (around the 7-8th stop) to Binary 6 (Virtebo) and off at first stop (Quattro Venti) with less than 2 block walk.  As I had a meeting everyday for one week near the airport, her home was strategically located for both my work travels during the day and for 'Rome touring' during the evenings and weekends.  I truly felt like a local Italian staying with Simona as her home is located in a less 'touristy' part of Rome, yet minutes from the heart of Rome---both walking or Tram/bus/train.  As a newcomer to Rome, Simona kindly assisted me with maps/directions and recommendations for delicious and affordable places to (Website hidden by Airbnb) fact, one great place she recommended is next to Quatto Venti station (less than 2 blocks from her home) and I enjoyed several evening meals there after a long day of work!  As a 'lone' traveler, Simona made me feel so welcomed, safe, and comfortable in her home.  Her space is immaculately clean and the bed is a special retreat after walking all day!!  Simona went out of her way to make my stay a beautiful memory....with early morning breakfasts (yes, before the sun rises!), a key to come and go according to my schedule, and an amazing smile to welcome me 'home'....yes, a true 'home away from home' atmosphere.  For those who need WiFi, she provides free access within your room which was indispensable for me as I planned to also travel Italy and had not made any 'specific' plans prior to my Rome arrival.  Simona again kindly assisted me to arrange a place to stay in Assisi with her personal phone as I couldn't find anything online/email and couldn't speak Italian!  I am ever grateful to her warm kindness and caring person.  Traveling to foreign areas, especially as a single, female, can be frightening and thanks to Simona, my first Italian travels and first Airbnb experience are truly 'smilemakers' and I can hardly wait to return with my husband and share with him this amazing and memorable trip!  Grazie Simona!"
47149,3221629,2013-01-02,1153306,Axel,"My wife and I stayed 5 nights at Simonaâs. We rent the master bedroom, the one with an ensuite bathroom. Simonaâs apartment is really nice, it is decorated with a lot of taste. And, very important, it is neat and tidy. During our stay, Simona even made our bed sheets changed. 

The apartment is well located in Rome, in a very nice neighborhood called Trastevere. Itâs not the a touristic neighborhood in Roma, thatâs why we appreciated the location. Itâs a more typical. The apartment is 15 meters away from the Quatro Venti Train Station. It is very useful to go to the Vatican. To go to the city center, itâs better to catch the tram; line 8. Itâs about 700/800 m away from the apartment (~10 minutes).

Last but not least, Simona was a perfect host. She was thoughtful, very kind, and always smiling. She gave us very good tips to visit Rome, and some nice restaurant to go to.

I am sure you won't regret your stay at Simona's."
47149,3489901,2013-02-06,4808414,Frank,"I had a  wonderfull stay at La bella italia a casa di Simona.
My bedroom was spacious and the bed was just great.The bathroom was really nice and clean. Simona would wake up early and prepare a nice breakfast for me.
It is just one train stop, and from there you take bus 64 to the vatican and tour buses.
I would highly recomend Simonas place

47149,3832493,2013-03-19,4295024,Chunsong,"I stayed in this house for 20nights.
I'd like to say this house 7stars hotel rather than apartment.
Simona is really kind and well knows how to host her guests.
She prepared breakfast every early morning.
I could see my mom from her.
This 7 stars hotel is really clean and so comfortable.
She cleans the room everyday.
There are many good restaurants and market near this 7stars hotel. To those who are supposed to visit Rome, I recommend this bnb strongly. Nothing better than this bnb."
47149,4090966,2013-04-08,2068365,Matteo,Simona will go out of her way to make you feel home and her attention to details is absolutely over the top. The house contains two bedrooms with two bathrooms 1 kitchen and 1 very roman lounge where you could feel like in a Fellini movie. It should be the favourite stop for all airbnbers going to Rome!
47149,4177572,2013-04-16,4586695,Ilka,"We unfortunately could stay only six nights at SimonaÂ´s house and we departed as friends. It was a wonderful experience to stay in a real roman home and Simona was more than a host for us. She prepared two perfect dinners for us and we were lucky to taste the original roman ""cuisine"" which was so uncomarable to what we knew. Thank you so much Simona, and once again we will recommend your home to everybody who looks for a special and real wonderful experience in Rome. It will be unforgettable for us and we certainly will come back."
47149,4251643,2013-04-22,5622338,Jorg,"I had a great stay at Simona's apartment. She helped me out with any questions I had about Rome, suggested some nice places to visit and generally made me feel very welcome.

you can walk around in this community,easy to experience the local people's life.
there is a good restaurant near here,the foods are delicious and not expensive."
47149,4406547,2013-05-03,5683316,Samantha,I absolutely loved Simona's place. It was like a home away from home. Staying here made me feel like I had family in Rome. She was so warm and welcoming and the room was extremely clean and comfortable. I enjoyed every minute of my stay and highly recommend it!
47149,4529196,2013-05-11,93288,Fred,"Peggy and I spent seven nights at Simona's place.  Her directions from the airport via two different trains were clear and most helpful.  We arrived at her apartment building late in the evening but she welcomed us warmly and gave us an orientation on our room, bath, and the rest of her apartment.  Simona also spent some time helping us organize our sightseeing for the days ahead.  In the morning, Simona had an enjoyable breakfast ready for us at the time we requested.  Given our jet-lag, all of this was very useful for our first-time visit to Rome.

Simona is the perfect host and we will try and stay with her again should we return to the most-interesting Eternal City.  Many thanks, Simona, for your friendship, hospitality and concerns for a couple of travel-weary Americans!  Ciao!  Fred and Peggy"
47149,4838108,2013-05-28,790930,Cari Clemente,"Mi primera experiencia como huÃ©sped con Airbnb ha sido muy positiva. Simona es una mujer encantadora, muy amable y culta. Mi marido y yo sÃ³lo estuvimos dos dÃ­as en su casa la semana pasada, pero cuando nos fuimos sentimos como si nos hubiÃ©ramos conocido hace mucho mÃ¡s tiempo. La casa responde a las fotos que aparecen en la web. El desayuno era muy bueno y Simona muy atenta a que no faltase de nada. El barrio es muy bonito y estÃ¡ muy bien comunicado con el centro por autobÃºs tranvÃ­a y tren. Si se llega desde el aeropuerto de Fiumicino, el transporte en tren es rÃ¡pido, cÃ³modo y barato. Este alojamiento es muy recomendable."

I had a perfectly comfortable stay in a lovely apartment in charming part of Rome. I was worried about getting around from Monteverde, since there are no Metro stops nearby, but it was simple to the take the tram or bus wherever I wanted to go. Simona will be a great help to you if you want to know anything about the neighborhood or Rome, and I recommend you talk to her about anything related to Roman cuisine!"

I really enjoyed staying in Samona's beautiful BnB. "
47149,5147293,2013-06-15,6450661,Andrea,"Simona is a bona fide Roman and her house is a great pleasure  to be at. You can really get a good feeling for everyday life in Rome outside of the touristic areas. Public transportation is not frequent very early or very late in the day, so the location is better if you have many days to explore the city and/or if it's not your first time in town. None of which was my case, so I left wishing I had been able to spend more time in the house and with Simona. She's a very welcoming and well-traveled lady and it's very nice to chat with her. Also, she's a wonderful cook - the best meal I had in Rome was some leftover eggplant dinner that she had made for herself and was kind enough to give me some when I arrived late one day. You will definitely not regret staying at Simona's. "
47149,5259210,2013-06-21,6048711,Phil,"Simona is beautiful, and she makes the best coffee in all of Rome. Her place is in a great area with mostly locals; away from the touristy parts of Rome yet still walkable from all of the great spots. She is very close to the best view of Rome, and a beautiful park. Her ""continental breakfast"" was perfect to get you going for the day. Her coffee is wonderful. Simona did everything she could to make our stay memeorable and amazing. Thank you Simona. Your friends from Austin TX, Phil and Kristin. "

Her breakfast each morning was delightful and she refreshed our room daily. It was like staying at grandmas house, with a traditional Roman lady. We would love to return and stay with Simona in the future. We walked to the Trastevere square for dinner each evening in approx 15-20min. "

Simone's home is peaceful and cosy, which makes you feel like you got a sanctuary to escape to after a busy day out in Rome. Simona is a fantastic host. She went out of her way to make my stay a very comfortable one. One eve, I was home and didnt have water and she gave me her own last big bottle out of the fridge so I didn't have to go outside and get one. She's very sweet like that. The place is clean and it's at a good location. The train is only 5-7 min walk distance, and the train stops right infront of her door, metro is also at a close proximity. I would highly recommend this home away from home!"

The room - Spacious, clean, bright, warm and comes with an ensuite bathroom / WC so you can have total privacy. Comfortable bed. Router installed inside the room with good wifi signals. Â  

Location of the apartment - In a nice residential area. Quiet at night yet you feel safe walking around. Although not in the middle of the tourist area, it is very well-connected. The Quattro Venti train station is right next door, Â from where you can either take a 5-min train ride to Ostiense train station to connect to the Metro (Piramide station), or go the other direction to St Pietro train station (4 min) where you can take bus no.64 to St Peterâs Basilica, Piazza Venezia, or even the Roma Termini station. Another option is to walk 10 min to take tram no.8, and you will be in Piazza Venezia in 25 min, and all the major sights like the Roman Forum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon and Piazza Navona etc are within walking distance. Really convenient! Â  

The host - Simona is a kind, caring and gracious host. She speaks good English and is eager to offer help and advice, whenever you need them. She is always on time to make you breakfast. During my stay, breakfast was always ready and laid out for me whenever I woke up and Simona would immediately serve me hot coffee. Itâs Simona who has added so much to my first ever Airbnb experience Â and made my stay in Rome even more memorable. Â  

Grazie mille, Simona! Â

47149,11532831,2014-04-07,11051768,James,"We enjoyed Simona and her apartment very much!  She is super nice and accommodating and we really liked chatting with her.  She also helped us a lot with directions and tips about good places to go.  For example, she suggested we see some wonderful churches that most tourists miss and they were beautiful.  She arranged reservations for an outstanding meal at a restaurant frequented only by locals.  Make sure youâre clear about the public transportation schedules (buses, trains, and trams), as the apartment is not in the center of town.  Ask Simona about Gianicolo, the hill overlooking a gorgeous view of Rome, which is a short walk from her home.  Simonaâs kindness and generosity truly helped make our stay in Rome a delight."
47149,11666468,2014-04-11,1034665,George,"Simona is a great host, and made me feel very welcome in her home during 
my 4 day visit to Rome.
Simona also provided a map of the area, and directions of the best way 
to get to the major attractions.
The location is ideal for getting in and out of the centre of Rome.
I will definately stay with Simona the next time I visit Rome. "

Nos gusto mucho la zona, tranquila y de fÃ¡cil acceso. Tenias que tomar un tranvÃ­a que estaba a 10 minutos a pie del lugar y de ahÃ­ llegabas en 15 min. a piazza venezia (para nosotros la mejor opciÃ³n para ir al centro) desde ahÃ­ podÃ­amos recorrer todo caminando sin problemas, es muy cercano tambiÃ©n a solo una estaciÃ³n en tren de San Pietro para conocer la otra parte de la ciudad. Simona es por demÃ¡s de atenta y gentil, siempre predispuesta a ayudarnos en todo. Solo tenemos palabras de agradecimiento y afecto. Abrazos!"
47149,11933511,2014-04-19,11383663,David,"  Simona has one of the loveliest accommodations! We certainly enjoyed her gracious hospitality and how much she tried to be helpful to us!

  However the most amazing thing happened to us to be able to give her the very best top credit!  David left his money belt with his passport behind with a large amount of cash behind at her home and she  immediately contacted us through the chauffeur she arranged for us to find a way to get it to us. It was Easter Sunday and not easy to do this. But she made sure we safely got it back eventually through the next BnB hosts we used. All is well that ends well but Simona was extremely honest and pursued a happy ending for us! Fantastic!

Thank you Simona.

We arrived close to mid-night and was afraid of having a hard time getting a cab. Simona arranged a cab for us upon request and stayed up till we arrive. 

We got a map from her the next morning with recommended sight-seeing plan. Quite useful for us since we do not speak Italian and wanted to optimize #s and types of landmarks we see for the 5 days. She also recommended local restaurants with authentic food & reasonable price. 

Bed was comfortable & water pressure was good. She makes breakfast for us everyday. She also offered us to  leave the luggage in her flat for a few hours after we checked out and before we left for airport. That was very considerate of her so we did not have to drag a luggage with us while trying to get a last taste of Roma! 

Highly recommended! If we come back in town, we would definitely stay there again.

47149,13411786,2014-05-27,11133258,Benedict,"Had a lovely time staying at Simona's apartment. It is exactly as described and have no complaints! Simona was a very friendly host and every morning provided breakfast along with a brilliant fresh cup of Italian coffee!! While not in the smack in middle of the city, I had no problems with accessibility with public transport. There are also a few places to eat around the area that provided far better fare than around the touristy spots in the city. "

Simona's apartment and apartment building are clean, the conversation delightful, and the coffee-making tips useful!  Another bonus is that she had washcloths!  Trust me; Italy doesn't generally ""do"" washcloths, so that was a treat."

Her home is close to the train station and she can provide a pick-up service to and from the airport. She is very easy to get in touch with through text, cell, and e-mail. She also helped my friends find a place to stay when I found out they were meeting me in Rome. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. She is such as sweet woman, I feel lucky to have met her.

Simona is a lovely, very dedicated and really helpful host. She replied to me in no time to answer all my questions before I started my trip. Her description on how to get to her home was so precise that I had no problems at all.  
She helped me planning my days, gave me tips on where to go and which would be the easiest ways to get there. She even provided me with a map. Her breakfast coffee is the authentic Italian style and it was a good start to the day. 

The room is very nice. It was clean and the attached bathroom was really convenient. The twin bed was so comfortable...perfect to recover from exploring Roma. Simona's apartment is very close to a train stop and within 10 minutes you can also reach the next tram stop. The area is quite nice. Even walking alone at night I always felt save.

When I will return to Rome I definitely will stay with Simona again!  "

Simona was such a gracious host, and she was very helpful with making sure I got to the house okay. If you are looking for an authentic Italian experience, in a nice neighborhood & beautiful home then this is the place to go! You won't find a better host or home. "
47149,16425732,2014-07-27,17653737,Rohan,"*HOST... Simona is such a friendly and helpful host! She is very well prepared--equips guests with a map and a handy list of restaurant and site-seeing suggestions. 
We highly recommend you follow her suggestions that were geared more towards travelers, and not just the typical touristic recommendations--makes the visit that much more authentic :)

*ARRIVAL... Simona was very responsive and gave us updated info despite last minute changes in our travel plans...taking a train from the Roma Ostiense station is definitely a good idea since there's a stop very close to the apartment :)

*LOCATION... is convenient--right in front of the Quattro Venti station, close to the Vatican, and a short train/bus ride away from the Piazza Venezia, on the other side of the river.

*APARTMENT... very large flat, clean, and tastefully decorated. Breakfast was included :)

*ROOM.... was very spacious (not common in Italy!) and well maintained.  

*BATHROOM... one of the best on our trip through Italy! Beautiful red marble tiles and clean facilities with fresh, dried towels every day.

Overall, such a pleasant stay!

Staying in Simonas place is just an enjoyement! Just from the first time we've seen each other, she gave me the feeling of being at home. She is so funny, very open-hearted and kind Woman. 

Her Place is cute, we got a so called ""loversnest"", very cosy and the most important thing was, it gave us the feeling of being at home. 
Simona prepared for us a such heartily breakfast! She always asked us about if we want to go somewhere, if we need help ..etc. She is a goood Hostess! That was an experience, we will never forget. 
Grazie Mile Simona, and see you next time! Regards and big hug Dhenibe and Pascal"

Being on my own I felt safe coming back here at night, although the area does get quiet at night there are lots of shops restaurants etc. It's nice after a busy day in Rome! It's easy to get into the centre by tram. Breakfast was ready for me every morning(Nutella and coffee).
I would stay here again"

47149,20496369,2014-09-30,3462226,Susan,"I had the pleasure of staying with Simona for an entire week. She is a warm, friendly, helpful, lovely woman, and I happen know that she is one of *the best* AirBnB hosts in Rome. She goes the extra mile for each of her guests. A beautiful, spotless apartment in a great, authentic Roman neighborhood. It's a little removed from the tourist center, so depends on the kind of experience you're looking for. Simona prepares a traditional Roman breakfast each morning, and provides clean sheets and towels on a regular basis. She is a key reason why my trip to Rome was such a success. She is the best! "

It is clear she takes hosting very seriously and treats her guests with warmth and is concerned for their well-being. 

I received help with my travels; she made great suggestions and even called other hosts to check availability for my next stop along my trip.  She also called the Borghese Museum to reserve tickets for me.  Exceptional!

Her home is a large apartment with beautiful art and is very tastefully decorated. My room was lovely and my private bathroom was gorgeous.  Everything is high quality and immaculately clean!   

I was served breakfast every morning and she even prepared eggs for me along with other Italian delights.  

Simona's apartment is located right in the heart of Trastevere, over a busy road with noise, activity and traffic too. If you don't mind the sounds of a busy location, it is the perfect place to come and be welcomed by Simona who is a lovely, kind and thoughtful host.  

I loved my stay with Simona for she is a very special person and deeply feels and cares for her guests. She was very accommodating and I so appreciated her kindness.

Highly recommend! "
47149,21146155,2014-10-12,20568937,Deepti,"Staying with Simona was one of our best air bnb (Website hidden by Airbnb) felt like home away from home. She was so kind to wait up for us when we landed really late. The rooms are just like in the pictures and she is very particular about cleanliness which is an added advantage. We interacted with her like a friend and exchanged many stories about ourselves and our cultures.we were her first guests from India and she was only more particular about leaving a lasting impression and needless to state,lived up to it very much! 

The apartment is close to a train station and a few minutes walk to the tram station. Very close to the Vatican and roughly about 15 mins by tram to get to the main piazzas. It's better to understand how to travel from one place to another from Simona before one begins a days sight seeing and Simona is very cued on to transportation in the city.

Thanks a lot for having us and treating us like family Simona. It was indeed a very pleasurable stay. Loved the coffee and all the special attention!!! 

Regards,
Rocky and Deepti:)"

47149,22067597,2014-10-29,20162500,Charles And Barbara,"Simona was available when we arrived and welcomed us to her place. The apartment was as described in the posting. It was clean and well maintained. Simona offered a good breakfast, good conversation, plenty of good advice and information about Rome and the logistics of getting around in it. She recommended very good restaurants in the neighborhood. Her location is in a residential area and we felt safe walking to the restaurants and the local shops. Simona was the third host we used with Airbnb and was by far the best. "

She gave great advice about places to see in Rome and helpful information on directions and transportation. Since I've already been to Rome sometimes she gave me advice on less known attractions and things to see, which were very nice. The facilities were great, the appartment is really beautiful, clean and of good standard. The bed is very comfortable and the bedroom faces a quiet backyard. The breakfast consisted of  tasteful Italian pastries  with delicious coffee. The appartment is situated in a calm residential area in the Trastevere, and it is easy to reach the city center by local train or tram/bus. Staying at Simonas gives you insight on Italian lifestyle and a more genuine travel experience than if you stay in a hotel. I would definitely like to come back to Simona for my next trip to Rome and would reccomend La casa di Simona to everyone:) "

I was very tired when I arrived and she let me sleep uninterupted, which was lovely.  I felt very much at home, and enjoyed her home, her conversation and her hospitality!  She lives on a lovely, tree lined street, and her home is beautifully decorated and comfortable.  She also provides a wonderful breakfast and delicious, authentic, homemade, espresso/coffee.  I highly recommend staying with her and I plan on staying with her again on my next trip through Rome."

I am very grateful to find her bnb with a lucky accident or help by angels.  Next chance to be in Roma, I will definitely be back to Simona's.  

Thank you, Simona, who made me feel a part of the city.  Now I am falling in love with Roma and you!!"

Simona a Ã©tÃ© d'excellent conseil sur notre programme bien chargÃ© de visites. Toujours disponible, elle nous a guidÃ© au quotidien dans notre pÃ©riple Romain. Simona n'a pas hÃ©sitÃ© Ã  solliciter ses contacts et passer quelques coups de tÃ©lÃ©phone pour rÃ©pondre aux questions que nous avions. 
La chambre est trÃ¨s confortable et vous apportera le repos nÃ©cessaire aprÃ¨s de longues journÃ©es de marche. La salle de bain privative est spacieuse et de qualitÃ©.
L'appartement est situÃ© au pied de la colline de Trastevere. La gare du mÃªme nom est Ã  une centaine de mÃ¨tres ce qui est trÃ¨s pratique pour les trajets vers l'aÃ©roport. 
Il est Ã©galement bien desservi par la ligne de tramway mais vous pourrez facilement faire vos trajets vers le centre de Rome Ã  pieds et visiter ainsi le quartier qui est agrÃ©able.
Nous vous recommandons donc cet appartement sans aucun doute.
Merci Simona et Ã  bientÃ´t :)
Pierre et Anne-Laure"
47149,29790271,2015-04-12,28520004,Mansha,"Simona made me and my friend feel instantly welcome when we reached her apartment. She gave us clear instructions on how to reach her place, and was very forthcoming on all that Rome had to offer. She clearly loves Roma :)

The neighbourhood is very nice, though a little far from the city's centre and all attractions. We had to travel to the city and back everyday, across the bridge. You have multiple modes of transportation - tram, train, bus etc, so it is convenient.

The room was as described in the listing - clean, homely and very comfortable. Simona left no stones unturned to ensure we had a comfortable stay - she was ready with breakfast first thing in the morning. Oh starting the day with the amazing Roman coffee and croissant was a treat, more so thanks to her company :) The only thing was we were in a rush all days because of our packed itinerary, but whatever time we had, we loved to hear all about Roma from Simona :)

All in all, Roma felt like visiting family! Hope to see you again Simona! Ciao :)"
47149,30433018,2015-04-21,5684259,Marva,"Simona is a VERYwarm enchanting person who takes great pride and pleasure in attending to her guests. I only stayed one night but had a really enjoyable conversation with her about Rome, her life and her interests that I will always treasure.

The best part about the double room is that the bathroom is ""en suite"" (attached), the shower water pressure was excellent (which is exactly what I needed after an exhausting day of touring the Vatican and navigating back to Sonia's apartment). Everything was super clean.

Sonia's neighborhood is residential and sits on a hill behind Trastevere. There is a restaurant nearby in the regional train station ""Quattro Venti"". Although Sonia's apartment is not really walking distance to anything, you easily can hop on a regional train, tram and/or bus to get  to get to sites of interest such as The Vatican or the popular neighborhood Trastevere. I really love to walk around and get to know cities when I travel but I chose to stay at Sonia's place because of the great reviews she has received. It was very pleasant but I realize that I prefer a more convenient central location where I can walk everywhere I want to go and not rely on trains, buses, trams.

Breakfast was very nice. Sonia prepared coffee, had biscuits, yogurt and juice available. She also arranged for private transport to the airport with a very prompt, professional, handsome, enchanting driver. It was a very nice way to end my stay in Rome. I arrived at the airport in plenty of time to catch my flight home....

Mil grazie Sonia!"

The room and the flat were very clean and comfortable. The flat is near the tram and train station. Simona made us every morning a perfect start with her espresso and breakfast and her knowledge about Rome. You can ask her everything and she knows everything. Even we have been there for only a short period of time, we became friends. We had long chats and cold limoncello on her balcony. It was superb! Simona, thank you so much for everything. Molto carina! Ciao until the next time! Grazie!"

The house and room are beautiful and the breakfast was great. The location is 1 stop away from Trastavere. Would definitely recommend this place and will surely go back some time!

La casa era pulitissima e in perfetto ordine, a due passi dalla stazione quattro venti."

Simona is such a great host: she takes care about her guest and she is able to make them feel like home. She is a ""romana doc"" and she gave us precious advice about what to visit and how to move around the city.
It was a pleasure spend few days with her, we would recommended her (and her house) without doubt.

Simone ist eine  sehr offene, unkomplizierte und liebe Gastgeberin, bei der man sich sofort wohl fÃ¼hlt. Sie ist wirklich unglaublich hilfsbereit und freundlich. Sie hat uns sehr viele Tipps gegeben und wir haben die kleinen GesprÃ¤che mit ihr sehr genossen. 
Uns hat es sehr gut gefallen und wÃ¼rden sehr gerne wieder kommen. VIELEN DANK fÃ¼r die wunderschÃ¶nen Tage in Rom.

I had amazing time at Simonaâs. She is a perfect host: she takes care about her guests, she is always ready to help with any question. In addition to other comments Iâd like underline that Simona is Roma native and she can give you very good advice about city attractions and restaurants and, if you wish and have enough time, also organize exciting trip through the non-tourist places with a guide. Simona is a very nice person, I liked her with all my heart. Simona, thank you so much. I hope that Iâll return Rome at January."

Elle aime faire dÃ©couvrir sa ville de Rome et s'ingÃ©nie Ã  s'adapter Ã  vos attentes pour conseiller les visites, rÃ©server les musÃ©es et les restaurants ou raconter des anecdotes sur la ville. L'appartement est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able, vaste et dÃ©corÃ© avec soin. La chambre est spacieuse et la salle de bains de marbre rose attenante est charmante. Le quartier,un peu Ã  l'Ã©cart du centre historique se trouve Ã  deux pas du jardin du Gianicole. Un lieu de promenade dÃ©licieux qui vous apporte fraÃ®cheur et vue incroyable sur la ville. Par ailleurs on se sent ""dans la vraie vie"" des Romains dans ce quartier. En dix minutes vous pouvez Ãªtre Ã  Saint Pierre, en vingt minutes en plein coeur du centre historique.

Ã una persona squisita, ci ha fatto sentire come a casa e dato tantissime informazioni utili per visitare Roma con gli occhi di chi ci vive, dato consigli, prenotato taxi, ristoranti, preparato con cura colazioni, compresa una ricchissima e speciale colazione pasquale. L'appartamento Ã© molto bello, la camera e il bagno dedicati agli ospiti accoglienti e pulitissimi. Anche la privacy Ã© garantita. La distanza dal centro non Ã© eccessiva e comunque i mezzi per raggiungerlo sono comodi. Assolutamente consigliato, e anche noi torneremo presto con piacere da lei.

Simona's hospitality exceeded our expectations:  she is a professional and  enthusiastic host and first of all a beautiful person. Simona gave us useful tips to visit Rome out of the beaten tracks. She daily helped us planning our tours and meals; she prepared delicious breakfasts every morning and even a special roman Easter breakfast. Her house is  really beautiful and the room and bathroom she dedicates to her guests are cosy and clean and grant privacy at any time. The house is not far from the center and well served by train and buses. We definetely recommend Simona's place for vacation in Rome."

Ein sehr nettes Haus fÃ¼r die Mittelklasse - hohe Decken, Parkett, Marmor im Bad etc. Der (unterirdische) Bahnhof Quattro Venti ist nur 30 m vom Haus entfernt.
Simona ist eine Gastgeberin wie man sie nur wÃ¼nschen kann. Ich habe das GefÃ¼hl, bei den Verwandten zu sein! Sie hatte mir jeden Morgen wertvolle Tipps gegeben, mir seinen Lieblings-Aussichtspunkt gezeigt, fÃ¼r mich eine Limousine zum Flughafen organisiert (ich musste leider sehr frÃ¼h abreisen) - was will man mehr!
Vielen Dank, Simona!!!! Wenn ich wieder mach Rom kommen soll, werde ich mir keine andere Unterkunft suchen!

Further, her home is beautiful and immaculate. We really felt we were living like Romans. The apartment is in a great location in a residential neighborhood close to the center, but away from the tourists. As a result, it was much quieter than the center.

Simona's hospitality is what truly made my experience memorable, though.  Everything from her simple yet delicious breakfast (that homemade bread!), the clean and spacious bedroom with personal bathroom, to her ""concierge"" skills (her recommendations will not disappoint), she made my first Airbnb experience and my first trip to Rome one that I will carry with me for a very long time.

She truly loves her city and shares that with her guests. Want to know where to go, where to eat, how to get there? Ask Simona.

Her apartment is conveniently located so one can walk to, grab a cab, take a bus or train to many places. She even arranges airport drop-offs. She truly is a great host that makes you feel like you have family in town. Priceless. I didn't know but she provides breakfast and the best espressso.

Simona has really mastered the art of hosting guests to perfection.

Simona's home is spotless clean and beautifully decorated - I loved all the little exquisite details. 
Simona's place really has a character unlike many generic hotel rooms or apartments. 

The neighborhood is also great. Quiet but close to the center and has nice restaurants with good italian food. 

Simona's hospitality deserves 6 out of 5 stars. 
Simona eagerly helped me out with travel tips when i needed an advice and prepared the tastiest homemade bread for breakfast which she kindly served every morning.

Her house in located in south Trastevere. While there, I only took taxis but never paid more than â¬15 for one and usually less.  

Her house is very nice. The bathroom was great and nice to have a private bath. Her building is secure and equipped with a lift which was very helpful. She does not have air conditioning but has fans in each room. I'm already planning my next stay with her and would highly recommend her!"

Her home is beautifully decorated; my room had a very comfortable queen size bed with an ensuite marble bathroom! She prepares Italian bread, cereal, yogurt, coffee or tea for breakfast daily depending on your daily schedule.  Did I mention the patio? There is a small patio area surrounded by plants and flowers offering a sweet outdoor respite from all the walking you do in Rome. Simona is a rare gem in the Airbnb world. She is honest, sincere and displays the highest level of integrity. You are treated like a guest in a grand home. And she loves to listen to your latest daily journey; while making you feel like you are at home.  I stayed for 7 days and now consider Simona a friend."

Simona made us feel like family, she prepared a breakfast table for us each morning and made us fresh espresso and helped us plan our day, even makeing reservations as needed and booking cabs. She also shared stories about her long ancestry in Roma. Staying with Simona really heightened our experience in Italy and we definitely recommend staying with her if you are looking for a deeper connection to Rome one day. She is also fluent in many languages, including Spanish, French and English! She is a super host!!"

Sheâs one of the best hosts, and kindest people, you are likely to find anywhere. The location is great, good food is nearby, and the rooms are spotlessly clean and comfortable."
47149,269485416,2018-05-27,2850636,Amanda,"WOW. AMAZING. Simona has a lovely flat, and yet it does not compare to her beautiful personality and heart. Not only did she arrange a professional private car from the airport at the best rate, but she also made us feel right at home. This was my grandmother's first experience with AirBnB, and Simona is the embodiment of what it means to show someone that they can belong anywhere. From a delicious Roman breakfast each morning, to warm conversation and great travel suggestions as we stopped by throughout the day, and even a freshly spruced up room each night, we could not have hoped for a more wonderful trip. She can arrange a private car or call a taxi for you as needed, has a background as a professional chef  (great if you are hoping to arrange a pasta making class!), and has a wealth of knowledge regarding the sights of the city. We were able to enjoy her company while also having our own space, just as if we were staying with a dear friend--and you will find that Simona is the kind of woman that creates a place in your heart, for her and also for Rome! We cannot wait to stay with her again. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Simona, for helping us create an unforgettable memory. *Some things to note: her building has an elevator for easy access, is perfectly close to a train station (taxis are also very cheap to major sightseeing destinations), has a convenience store right next door, and is a very popular listing--so if you are searching for the perfect home base, look no further and be swift! My grandmother has stayed in hotels near the Colosseum and Trevi Fountain before (for 3x the price!) and far preferred the charm of a personal, cute Roman neighborhood."

Antonio and his father are polite, responsive and friendly. The location is near to metro Marconi and quite suburban. It is a little far from restaurants and and tourist attractions but this was not a big problem for me. It's a good location for a business traveler and an alternative to some of the nearby conference centres hotels."

Su trato fue siempre sincero y jovial, siempre estaba disponible y se preocupaba de hacerme sentir como en mi propia casa. 
Simona es una mujer culta, de mucho estilo e seÃ±ora encantadora. 
AprendÃ­ de su belleza, sensibilidad y conocimiento.  DescubrÃ­ con ella lo valioso que es hacer las cosas con el corazÃ³n y que sentirse joven no es una cuestiÃ³n de edad sino de mentalidad. 
No olvidarÃ© aquellos dÃ­as donde me contaba sus historias de viajes y vivencias a lo largo del mundo... Simona es una joya y poder conocerla una bendiciÃ³n, ella me hace querer ser mejor persona.

Su apartamento estÃ¡  ubicado en una de las mÃ¡s exclusivas zonas de Roma - Monteverde Vecchio.  Esta zona estÃ¡ muy bien conectada con el centro de la ciudad por medio de tren, tram y buses. Hay supermercados, restaurantes, reposterÃ­as y servicios fÃ¡cilmente accesibles en menos de 5 minutos caminando. 
El apartamento estÃ¡ en muy buenas condiciones de mantenimiento y limpieza. Desde el primer dÃ­a que llegas te darÃ¡ valiosas recomendaciones romanas para que tu estadÃ­a sea maravillosa.

He tenido la oportunidad de convivir con Simona y su familia, por mÃ¡s de 5 meses por lo que recomiendo completamente este apartamento ya sea para rentar una recÃ¡mara sencilla (como la mÃ­a) o doble en estancias cortas o largas. 
Gracias Simona por todos los dÃ­as hacerme sonreÃ­r.!!!

My story begins on March 31 when I get at home Simona Patriarca ... and since that first day, the experience was always something special ...

Their treatment was always sincere and nice, she was always available and eager to make me feel like my own home.
Simona is an educated woman, very stylish and lovely lady.
I learned of her beauty, sensitivity and knowledge. She always said to me that is always more valuable to do your duties with the heart and feeling young is not a question of age but of spirit.

His apartment is located in one of the most exclusive areas of Rome - Monteverde Vecchio. This area is very well connected to the city center by train, tram and bus. Supermarkets, restaurants, bakeries and services easily accessible in less than 5 minutes walk.
The apartment is very well maintained and clean. From the first day you arrive Roman will give valuable recommendations to make your stay prosperous.

I have had the opportunity to interact with Simona and her family for more than 5 months so thoroughly recommend this apartment to either rent a single bedroom (like mine) or double for a short or long stay.
Simona Thanks for making me smile everyday.!!!!

She gave me invaluable advices where to go, what to see, what to buy (oil, cheese, wine). The highlight of my trip was a lunch with Simona and her family. I learned why there are 2 forks, one knife and no spoon :) It was the best matriciana I've eaten ever! Simona gave me a real taste of Italian hospitality.
It's a pity there are only 5 stars. Simona deserves 10!"
49206,2660333,2012-10-19,2447342,Anthony,"Exceptional! The name of Simona's bnb, ""Rome at Simona's House,"" is perfect,  because Simona and her house are truly Roman: sunny, airy, warm and affectionate without ever being intrusive. My stay and experiece with Simona were incredibly pleasant. The house is impressively clean and elegant, and the rooms and bathrooms are large and airy. The breakfast and table settings refined and abundant. 
Simona revels in meeting people form around the world and sharing her hospitality. Her knowledge and love of her city are illuminating, and she is well informed from both the remote past to the present. Rome should be proud to have Simona.

She even took me to see an extremely beautiful place which was one of the highlights of my trip. I loved coming home every night and felt very happy here.

49206,6634530,2013-08-19,7907715,Colin,"This was my first time in Roma. I was very excited but had no idea where to start. Our flight arrived very late at night and Simona waited up for us to make sure we got in safely. She is a fantastic host! On our first day she prepared a fantastic breakfast for us and she would make breakfast every morning after that for my cousin and I. She pulled out a map and showed us all of the wonderful sites in Roma. She then showed us how to get from our home to the center of Roma via Tram 8. Her home is about 15 minutes away from downtown via the tram and it's only about a 30 minute walk. And if you walk up the road a little ways and then turn right and walk up the hill you will end up on a gorgeous hill where you can over look all of Rome. Walk down the hill and you end up in Plaza Santa Maria which is a very lively spot for the day and nightlife.  Her rooms are very nice. We had the room with the couch bed and fold out bed. It is very quiet near her house so you can always sleep well and in our case, late. Simona was very kind to us and treated us as if we were family. She told us the best places to visit and eat. 
On our last night she organized the most fantastic pasta meal I've ever had. The restaurant was absolutely fantastic. (It's very rare for me to eat pasta because I am gluten free but this was something else. It was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!)

49206,8432467,2013-10-30,8490617,Jeam,Simona's house in Rome is very beautiful. What makes it more beautiful is the presence of Simona who tries to make her guests feel comfortable and welcome.

Simona was always quick to respond, and helped me with directions from the train station to her apartment. I was personally escorted up to the apartment which was beautiful and Simona immediately helped me plan my day in Rome. The location is great, a little out of the city but an easy tram ride away. She prepared breakfast for me every morning and was an absolute delight to be around, making me feel very at home. I will hopefully stay here again in the future."
49206,8799453,2013-11-18,8560381,Josh,"Simona is one of the best hosts you will find on Airbnb. Allow me to list her numerous good qualities. She keeps the apartment perfectly clean and organized at all times. She is willing to help you with anything you need. She has lived in Rome her entire life and is delighted to talk with you about the city and the lifestyles of its native residents. She is educated, intelligent, and wise, and a great conversationalist. She is an absolute believer in the importance of the host-guest relationship. For her, being an Airbnb host is about being the best host possible, not about maximizing profit and minimizing effort. I was very impressed by this. It is similar to the experience of living with a host family on an exchange program.

As I noted above, her apartment is kept perfectly clean and organized at all times. It is quite big and spacious, as is the bedroom--the perfect size. The apartment is located in Monteverde, a quiet residential neighborhood on the Western side of the Tiber River. To get to central Rome, where all the touristic sites are, you walk down to the tram (5-10 minutes), then take a 15 minute tram ride to the center of Rome, Piazza Venezia. I didn't find this a problem because I'd just go in for the day and come back in the evening. It was also nice to stay in an area of Rome that I probably wouldn't have visited. The central area of Rome is very touristy, and it's often difficult to find good and reasonably priced restaurants. Tourist traps are everywhere. I enjoyed eating dinner at restaurants patronized by only local Romans, with good food and good prices.

I would give Simona my highest recommendation. She is one of those rare finds on Airbnb."

La recomiendo con seguridad. "

Her house is amazing! Her house is just like a personal gallery, everything is so exquisite! The room is so comfortable,make me feel at home! I would love to 100% recommend Simona and her house! She is super!"

Simona speaks English very well, and the house is very clean and beautiful. Thank you very much Simona :)"
49206,10292642,2014-02-11,10444702,Mary,"Simona is a warm and generous host who was exceedingly kind to me, particularly when I received sad news from home.  The apartment is well located, warm and comfortable and as other reviews noted, her coffee is outstanding!  Her advice on travel around Rome is invaluable as well as her recommendations for restaurants etc.  Thank you Simona - I do hope we meet again one day soon!  You are a very special lady."
49206,10793892,2014-03-08,5026879,Wolfgang,"Ero stata da Simona per tre settimane e finalmente devo dire che sia molto contento. Simona e' una ospitante molto premuroso e accogliente.
Ich war Gast bei Simona fÃ¼r fast drei Wochen und muss sagen, dass Simona eine sehr aufmerksame und einladende Gastgeberin ist."
49206,10889515,2014-03-11,12549578,Denise,"This is a terrific place to stay... For a single gal! Classy and colourful with all you need and more... My first time in Rome, Simona gave me map on arrival from Australia, cup of the best coffee and the tram route- now go and enjoy my city Rome - you are my guest in my city... Great area, great Restaurant down the rd at Quatro Venti Station.... Thanks so much Simona for a great introduction... I will be back! Denise Officer from Darwin Australia"
49206,11126876,2014-03-22,11655783,Alcibiade,"Quel bonheur de sÃ©journer chez Simona : son professionnalisme, son accueil chaleureux, sa disponibilitÃ©, son amour pour sa ville et ses conseils prÃ©cieux sont un vrai cadeau pour le visiteur de Rome. 
Son appartement charmant est meublÃ© avec goÃ»t de meubles et d'objets qui ont une vraie histoire.
L'accÃ¨s aux principaux sites de Rome est trÃ¨s facile.
Un avis positif donc, sans restriction aucune."
49206,11262454,2014-03-27,12115377,Katharina,"It was my first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better. Simona, a born Roman, knows her city by heart and shares all her knowledge with her guests. I felt warmly welcome in her clean and nice rooom. Highly recommended!!!"
49206,11660927,2014-04-11,12267202,Patricia,"SImona es una persona adorable, amorosa y muy contenedora. Para mi fue un placer haberla conocido. La casa de Simona es un lugar ideal para estar en Roma y sentirte como en tu casa. La habitacion comoda, espaciosa, lo mismo el bano y en especial Simona, la duena de  casa, que siempre esta dispuesta a  pasarte los datos que necesites y  ayudarte. Lamentablemente estuve pocos dias, pero bastaron para extranar las charlas y la hospitalidad de Simona. Muy recomendable. "
49206,11785576,2014-04-14,2114781,Mary,"Simona's apartment is delightful. She is a great host, very helpful with information and advice.
I would stay with her again if I visit Rome."
49206,11835357,2014-04-16,12962977,Deanna,"Simona is very kind and thoughtful! She is very knowledgeable about the best ways to get around. Simona also was very sweet and woke up early to make me a cappuccino before I had to leave for my morning flight out of Rome. 

Simona's place was very easy to find and very close to the quatro venti train station."
49206,11907867,2014-04-18,2755777,Alexis,"Simona's was a lovely place to stay . Clean, comfy room in a lovely quiet and safe neighborhood. Great position few minutes walk to train station, and was able to be in the centre of Rome in 10mins. Simona is lovely and very knowledgable on roman cuisine, she gave wonderful reccomendations, and made reservations for me. Will defiantly return to stay there the next time in Rome! "
49206,12118367,2014-04-23,9503315,Francis,"My trip included several stops and this one will likely be the most memorable. Simona's place is impeccably clean. She's attentive, detailed and helpful. She made a couple of restaurant recommendations that were right on. "
49206,12512481,2014-05-04,14654629,Roxanne,"Great bnb, loved the location and host!"
49206,12618738,2014-05-06,13444321,Russell,Simona was a very gracious host and did everything she could to make my visit to Rome a memorable one.
49206,12771643,2014-05-11,9881180,Tracey,"Staying in Simona's immaculate apartment was my first airbnb experience, and I couldn't have wished for better. Simona is a very kind and considerate host, who is eager for guests to enjoy her city. There were lots of excellent tips about places to go, local restaurants, and transport around the city. I had a glorious time in Rome, and the location of the apartment was perfect. Trastevere is a leafy , safe residential area, close to transport and within walking distance of many key sites. Simona asks guests what it is they want their Rome experience to be, and then provides all the tips to make it happen. Definitely recommended!
"
49206,12871971,2014-05-12,15258346,Paola,"l'ospitalitÃ  e la gentilezza di Simona sono incredibili! La casa Ã¨ accogliente e confortevole, consigliatissima!"

49206,13308060,2014-05-25,1934234,Leo,Simona is a friendly and welcoming host.  Her coffee is just the item needed to get a great start on a day of sightseeing.  She was helpful with any sightseeing activities.  I definitely recommend staying with her!
49206,13567830,2014-05-31,12338888,Stephanie,"I had a great stay in Rome. Simona takes a lot of pride in her role as a host and provided a perfectly clean and comfortable room, breakfast and coffee - even on early mornings! - and thoughtful suggestions for what to see and do based on my interests. I really appreciated this level of care and hospitality and would definitely stay here again if I'm lucky enough to visit Rome in the future. Many thanks Simona! "
49206,13907450,2014-06-08,11619088,Margaret,Simona was a very nice person & very helpful. Happy to have met her
49206,14150968,2014-06-13,14339435,Jennifer,Simona is a wonderful host! She is very sweet and gave excellent tips on where to go in Rome. She even called the Vatican for me (I don't speak Italian) to ask about tickets. Her apartment is in a great location. It is in a cute area with an amazing restaurant across the street. There is a train or a tram that can take you to all the sites within minutes. Simona knows all the bus routes and I got around Rome no problem! I traveled Italy alone and Simona made my stay in Rome very memorable! I highly HIGHLY recommend staying with Simona. 
49206,14247295,2014-06-15,1345005,Androulla,"Simona is a gracious and considerate host; her immaculate appartment was a welcomed respite from the throngs of tourists in the city centre (it's just a short tram-ride away) in a nice, leafy neighbourhood."
49206,14427305,2014-06-19,13509525,Jessica,"Rome was wonderful! Simona was a great host. Breakfast every morning. She took my to get my clothes washed and took me for a facial! She also organised a friend to show me the city and I had a great time with his friends at dinner! I would recommend staying at Simonas, she is very kind and caring. "
49206,14519523,2014-06-21,15659664,Stephen,"Simona is as close to the perfect host as you can imagine: kindly, welcoming and informative especially when it comes to questions about the city, cuisine and culture she loves. The room I stayed in was perfect; spacious, airy, well presented and appointed with a tiny rustic terrace immediately outside. As to location, this too was close to perfect, with easy access to Rome central via tram or train and an excellent restaurant within 5 minutes walk. Thank you Simona and I can't recommend this listing highly enough.  "
49206,14632969,2014-06-23,14953376,Tim,"Simona is a great host in a beautiful building on a tree lined street in Rome. St. Peters square was a 10 minute taxi ride from her place. There were two restaurants and a market within a hundred yards of her place. Great coffee and breakfast and Simona who is into Roman cooking loves to talk about it.
Oh yeah, by the time I got to Rome, I spent 9 days in Paris, 10 days in Naples and walked everywhere. Wasn't used to walking. When I saw a Jacuzzi tub I was happy!"
49206,14694004,2014-06-24,3289512,Katherine,Excellent hostess.
49206,15108658,2014-07-02,13071865,Tim,"I was looking for a place to stay in Trastavere that was in a quiet neighborhood, but within a close range of fun activities. This place definitely met these criteria, but my strong recommendation derives just as much from the place itself as from Simona's hospitality. She was one of the most gracious and friendly hosts I've had the pleasure of staying with, providing me with great advice about her neighborhood and the Vatican, and personally serving me breakfast both days (and even waking up super early on my final day when I had to leave for the airport). It's an excellent spot!"
49206,16538295,2014-07-29,10878853,Allen,"This listing is actually not in Trastevere. It is in Monte Verde which means the tourist sights are not walkable. It is on a busy street in a zone of large boxy apartment buildings. You will not find old architecture or cobblestone streets here. However, the apartment is immaculate and Simona is a very attentive host--she will help you find your way on public transportation to anywhere you need to go. Also, there is a large and beautiful  park nearby if you like to jog. Finally, you will be far from the hordes of tourists here. I recommend taking her other room over this one as the shower is much better in terms of hot water. "
49206,16847454,2014-08-03,13109590,Brianna,Simona was an absolutely wonderful host! She was warm and welcoming but also gave me plenty of privacy. She helped give directions around the city and how to get to the major attractions. I had an incident where I missed my flight and she was very comforting and even called me a car to take me to the airport the next day. I would recommend Simona to anyone visiting Rome. 
49206,17093107,2014-08-07,10878853,Allen,Simona's apartment in Monte Verde is very clean and she is a very attentive host. She is prompt with breakfast every morning and will help you take public transportation to any of the tourist neighborhoods you need to get to from Monte Verde. 
49206,17854875,2014-08-18,15331974,Ruth,"I had a wonderful stay in Rome while with Simona. She was the most hospitable, friendly and helpful airbnb host that I have ever had. Simona gave lots of ideas of churches and places to visit, and also helped by calling museums to book tickets and to find out information. Simona even went out if her way to drive me to some beautiful places in Rome that are not well known by tourists. I was even very blessed to have Simona cook a traditional roman meal - lasagne- for me!! Breakfast was provided each day at the time I desired, and with a selection of pastries coffee yoghurt and toast. 

The room was large with a comfortable bed and large bathroom. The apartment was 20-30 mins walk to Vatican City and just 1 minute from the overground train station which connects you to the underground metro line. 

What a splendid stay I had while with Simona. She became like my Italian mother and I will definitely return to visit her again in Rome one day. 
"
49206,18217493,2014-08-23,20223388,Marco,"Simona Ã¨ una super Host, sono felice di averla conosciuta ;-)
La casa Ã¨ molto curata ed accogliente, non Ã¨ difficile da raggiungere muovendosi con il tram o il treno locale, proprio come descritto nell'annuncio. Durante i giorni di permanenza ho provato la sensazione di ""sentirmi come a casa"".
Dalle informazioni su come raggiungere l'appartamento, all'accoglienza, l'attenta ospitalitÃ , gli aiuti e i consigli su come meglio spostarsi con i trasporti pubblici, le curiositÃ  su musei, monumenti o quartieri da visitare, fino alle chiacchiere... 
Non c'Ã¨ modo migliore di visitare Roma se non con le indicazioni di una persona che vive e ama la propria cittÃ  come Simona!"
49206,18401178,2014-08-26,12084140,Jason & Nicola,"Simona is a great host and she has a lovely apartment.
Very spacious room and a nice bathroom, both of which are clean and tidy.
The train station is just a couple of minutes walk away and the tram stop a little further along the road making it a really good base for sightseeing.
Excellent breakfast and coffee each morning.

49206,18719960,2014-08-31,17126006,Martin,"Por mÃ s que mi estadÃ­a en Roma  haya sido tan breve, puedo dar fe que el haberme alojado en casa de Simona ha sido una excelente opciÃ³n. El apartamento es cÃ¡lido y comodo, el desayuno casero, una delicia y la anfitriona, adorable y siempre bien dispuesta a ofrecer consejos Ãºtiles para aprovechar al mÃ¡ximo la estadÃ­a. En resumen, un servicio 5 estrellas!"
49206,19027497,2014-09-05,17452507,Jenny,"My second experience with Airbnb could not have been any better! Simona was the loveliest host, she provided me with clear instructions to her place before arrival (with immediate responses); she had prepared a map and pre-purchased bus ticket for me upon arrival, and gave me great recommendations during my stay. The room was spotless, beautifully decorated. I also had the bathroom all to myself, which she cleaned everyday. Every morning I'd wake up with the fresh aroma of home-made coffee and breakfast prepared by Simona! 

The location is a bit further away from the main tourist attractions, about a 20 minute tram ride away. But I actually preferred that way, I was able to see and feel the neighbourhoods and mingle with the locals. It is also quite close to the Vatican City, a nice 30 minutes stroll will get you there.

I would definitely stay with Simona again on my next visit "
49206,19472469,2014-09-13,19714726,Frank,"I enjoyed my stay with Simona very much.  Her communication before arrival concerning directions and such was very clear and helpful. Being just outside the city center, it was nice to have a metro station right across the street to take you to popular sites. And the restaurant at that station is also very good.  Tasty food and friendly people. Overall, The room is clean and tidy and Simona is very sweet and will try to accommodate all your requests. Also Simona, thank you for my breakfast to start me on my day."
49206,20027504,2014-09-22,6205918,Kevin,"Simona is truly a lovely person, caring and courteous, it is obvious that she loves meeting and hosting people. After directing me ( by e mail and by phone) exactly to her wonderful appartment, I arrived - late on Monday, tired and weary. I was immediately greeted by Simona , offered a drink and treated like a long lost friend! After settling myself, we had a chat about anything and everything. She showed me around her place, and asked me what I wanted to do and what I needed. Nothing was too much trouble- logging me on wifi,  plotting my morning run ( this is vital in the city of pasta and wine!) and pointing me towards a fantastic  and cheap local restaurant (where the mention of Simona's name gets you treatment George Clooney would envy!). The bedroom was great - very homely and the bed was super comfortable.  In the morning she made me fabulous coffee and breakfast, at the time  I wanted.  I had 24 hours in Rome so Simona helped me plan a whirlwind tour - optimising all tram, bus and train transfers. She was available by phone all day for any help or advice ( I confused St. Peter's bus station with St. Peter's train station - she sorted me out by phone - and in jig time).  Having said all that, Simona is the soul of discretion and had the knack of disappearing when I needed space. After check out, she very kindly minded my luggage until 6 pm when it was time for me to take my flight home.  
I have been in Rome several times -  it's always great, but this time was very special. The 24 hours were easy, relaxed, with real Romans. I'll definitely be back. Simona is a superb host and a very decent woman.
She even gave me a masterclass in how to make the perfect Roman coffee! If you're lucky, she may show you too! "
49206,20231564,2014-09-26,7142690,Charlene,Simona is a marvellous host. She prepared a lovely continental breakfast each morning and helped me with directions to all of the sights. Rome is a very busy city but I was able to find my way easily with her help.
49206,20500403,2014-09-30,17197705,Ji Wone,"Simona is just a wonderful host and Mom figure and I feel like I'm just home away from home. She always asked what the tomorrow's plan is to try to give help! I was able to get around town based on her help. I always felt good to get home when it is was around dinner time! Also, there is a great restaurant to eat out at a real reasonable price! She even arranged a car to get to the airport on the last day. I was really sad to leave the home. Hope to come back to Rome again!"
49206,20663723,2014-10-03,12969737,Dmitry And Anna,One of the best host in Italy i've ever had. Simona told me about near sights and most beautiful things that all people has to visit if they are going to Rome. She made lovely coffee. We spoke a lot and i felt like i'm at home. Will recommend to all my friends.
49206,20986460,2014-10-09,2207763,Kay,Simona was a fabulous host.  I loved staying with her!! My room was large and had a comfortable bed.  And my bathroom was gorgeous!  Lots of marble in it and quite large.  Breakfast was delicious.  Simona describes herself as a Roman woman.  And she is.  Her love for Rome is boundless and she wants to share all parts of it with you.  I highly recommend staying with Simona!!!
49206,21075091,2014-10-11,18872404,Nan,"Room's location is very good, is only 100 meters away from the station, Simona is a very good host. She is like my mother, prepared breakfast for me every day, and introduce Roman views very detail, next year I will travel to Rome again and simona is my only choice. 
"
49206,21154305,2014-10-12,20668075,Ket,"Simona was the perfect host. She's your Italian aunt. She made her place like the home away from home. 

I arrived early in Rome. She was able to accommodate me to drop off my luggage while I walked around. I also met some other travelers staying at the BnB and toured the sites with them.    "
49206,21336860,2014-10-15,11093205,Phyllis,"A lovely and IMMACULATE home, a gracious hostess, and a neighborhood where I, as a single woman walking alone in the night, felt totally comfortable.   The room is bigger than it looks and was three times larger than than my more expensive hotel accommodation down the street; the bath was nicer too!   
It's a pretty good location if you want to do things around the Forum/Coliseum as the 8 tram will take you very near there.(Plz. Venzia)  It is a Great Location if you are visiting people at the American Academy in Rome!  A 15 minute walk.
My fellow guests were very civilized Australian art lovers;  they were a delight and we had a wonderful conversation over breakfast
Simona was very helpful in all regards...transportation, reservations, restaurant tips.   
It would be hard to find a more congenial place to stay."
49206,21961554,2014-10-27,8926265,Feng Feng,"Simona is a lovely host. She keeps a beautiful home, provides delicious breakfasts and is immensely helpful with bookings, transportation and all sorts of wonderful advice. 

The room is well sized, clean and comfortable. The apartment is located in a safe and quiet neighbourhood, very close to the Quattro Venti railway station and a 5-10 minute walk from tram 8 to Piazza Venezia. There are several restaurants,shops and bars nearby, and the lift definitely comes handy with the suitcase.

I would love to stay with Simona again on my next visit."

49206,24122810,2014-12-20,321200,Carla,"If you need to rent a room in Rome, I don't think you can find a better place than Simona's! She is warm and welcoming, yet very discreet. Her house is spacious, elegant, immaculate and furnished with taste. The continental breakfast includes a variety of baked goods and fresh fruit and Simona will inquire after your tastes and try to accommodate them. You'll feel completely at home and at ease. Best of all, she'll help in any situation you might find yourself. I lost my wallet while in Rome. It was eventually returned, but for 24 hours I was without a penny. Simona insisted on lending me some cash, even though I was unable to repay her until after I returned home, as I had in the meantime canceled all my credit cards. She was warm and supportive, and you'll feel safe and as if among family with her. I cannot recommend her place more highly, and I will certainly return there when I'm back in Rome!"
49206,24663506,2015-01-01,21332758,Sean,"It was a great experience; breakfast was sweet and delicious, the room was clean and spacious, and Simona was very kind and homely. 

The flat is very close to Vatican City, and close to the center of Rome as well. I was able to walk back on New Years when the tram was closed. 

I was sick during my time there, and Simona took great care of me! She prepared a bath and had orange juice and even gave me medicine when I asked. She is very kind and wants you to have the best experience possible! "
49206,25116375,2015-01-06,9926424,Galina,"Simona is lovely host. Her place is cosy and comfortable. She is very attentive, caring and sweet. Since I had to go out early, she even woke up and prepared a breakfast of me at 7 am, which was earlier than scheduled. Simona gave me many advices where to go and what to see in Rome. If you like feeling at home even while travelling you will be pleased to stay at Simona's. "
49206,26848015,2015-02-20,27753120,Malcolm,"Simona was a very knowledgeable host who went out of her way to make me feel welcome. Lovely apartment in a quiet part of the city very convenient for bus/tram/train to centre and to Airport. Large comfortable room, lovely warm bathroom, good breakfast and very quick to work out what I enjoyed to eat. She kindly booked a museum ticket online for me, and to make recommendations on sights to see. Great communication. Highly recommended."

Every morning at breakfast she was full of ideas for lovely day trips and places to visit around the city. She is very knowledgeable about Rome, its history and politics and aside from that, clearly loves meeting new people and sharing her wonderful city with them.  It was a pleasure to have crossed paths with you and I hope to see you again soon Simona! Un abbraccio e a dopo!"

Elle a su me conseiller des Ã©vÃ©nements culturels en fonction de mes intÃ©rÃªts. Je recommande chaudement son accueil, et son appartement est fort agrÃ©able. 

Un conseil: l'appartement est situÃ© prÃ¨s d'une ligne du train de banlieue, mais apprenez Ã  vous servir des autobus, beaucoup plus pratiques.
"
49206,28359183,2015-03-22,10370407,Mubeen,Simona was really wonderful. She provided great directions on how to get to her place and waited for me to get there. The room is quite nice and very spacious for one person. The locations is about 2 minutes from a subway line. Simona was very helpful in how to get to the main sites and where to get good food. Thanks so much!
49206,28771707,2015-03-29,10500883,Emma,"Simona was the sweetest host, she made me feel welcome, and I thoroughly enjoyed our conversations. She's a cool lady with some good travel stories to share! The room was nice and big, with natural light and a huge desk, and the location is excellent. All in all a great stay, I would easily return to stay there again! Grazie cara, ci vediamo. "
49206,29206910,2015-04-05,15912937,Evan,Nice apartment in a nice and quiet neighbourhood a little away from city of Rome. Really near to Vatican City though! Host was extremely kind and make u feel right at home! Full recommendation to all who come to Rome.
49206,29393881,2015-04-07,21492373,Emilia,Simona is a lovely hostess who made me feel comfortable immediately upon arrival. I felt like part of her family and not just a guest.

I warmly recommend a stay at her place!
49206,29968289,2015-04-15,23051124,Maree,"Simona is a wonderful kind hearted lady who made my first trip to Rome very enjoyable. She assisted with transport and organising tours. The accommodation was beautifully clean and comfortable. Location is good between main city and Vatican city and reflects a local neighbourhood rather than a tourist area. I highly recommend Simona and her accommodation. 
 "
49206,30176112,2015-04-18,29389431,Will,"DON'T MISS THIS STAY! Simona made me feel right at home in foreign city I was staying in on my own. She went out of her way to take care of me - helped me find a place to iron my shirts, made a complimentary breakfast every morning - and was simply a loving, caring personality. The room was great as well, with plenty of space and a comfortable bed. And with the apartment only 400ft from the train station, getting into Rome was a breeze. I think my biggest concern was the distance to downtown, but, at the end of the day, it proved easy and cheap (1 Euro) to get where I wanted to go. I would highly recommend Simona and her apartment!   "

49206,30484753,2015-04-22,20446747,Josh,Simona is an amazing person and her home is classic Rome. She's a cool woman and went out of her way to make my stay in Rome comfortable and enjoyable.  I didn't expect to make a new friend and am happy I did.  Highly recommended to anyone. 
49206,30577926,2015-04-24,25426823,Alan,"The old saying ""When in Rome, do as the Romans do"" could not apply better than to our stay with Simona.  This lady is a national treasure.  She is steeped in history as is her house (I sat in a chair crafted by her grandfather).  The room was more than comfortable and breakfast was prepared for us each morning.  It is a lovely, quite neighbourhood and Trestevere is easily accessible with a tram just down the road.  But it is so much more than this to stay with Simona.  When she discovered we were on our honeymoon, she left a bottle of Prosecco on our table that evening.  She then booked us into an authentic Roman restaurant so we could experience the food she eat as a child and ordered a driver to pick us up the next morning to drive us to the airport.  Rome is filled with wonderful people but you will find it hard to find anyone as warm, inviting and genuine as Simona.  PERFETTO!

49206,30870465,2015-04-28,27945874,Anna,"This was my first air bnb experience and Simona has set an unbelievably high standard. Her home is comfortable and beautiful and set in a very peaceful and safe residential neighbourhood, halfway between Vatican City and the city centre. It is also easily reached from airport, abt 40 min by train.
But most important of all is Simona. She is a genuine, warm and loving lady who truly cares about her guests. 
She went out of her way to make me feel at home and to help me arrange to join her friends' excursion to villa d'este. I feel very lucky to have stayed at her house  and to have gotten know her. 
If you are coming to Rome, this is where you want to stay."
49206,31109238,2015-05-02,11287500,Arthur,"I've had a very good time (4 nights in single room) in this appartment with a luxury personal bathroom.  Simona, as hostess and her appartment couldn't be better and deserve both *****!"

She is a warm person, very welcoming who really cares about her guests. She is attentive and makes you feel at home. She definitly loves her city and knows it well so you can trust her recommandations to better discover Rome.
The place is very clean and Simona will prepare your breakfast at your convient time. The appartement is located in a residentiel area. It is not at a walking distance from places to visit but bus, rÃ©gional train and tram are close by."

La chambre est spacieuse et fraiche, quand il fait chaud dehors c'est apprÃ©ciable! Simona parle trÃ¨s bien le FranÃ§ais ce qui nous a permis d'avoir de beaux Ã©changes."
49206,32816798,2015-05-22,29463432,Katharina,"This was my first trip to Rome and I was more than lucky to have had the opportunity to stay with such a wonderful, welcoming and open-hearted host as Simona. She was very kind and so helpful in pointing out beautiful places in and around the city that often you wouldn't find in any tourist guide but give you a true insight into this ancient and vibrant city. She assisted me with organizing guided tours with knowledgeable art historians and shared her secrets of the best places where you can eat local food. I even took a pasta cooking lesson thanks to the tightly knit and well-organized Airbnb-hosts network in Rome. Her apartment is an expression of her exquisite taste, love of the arts and appreciation of detail. It is located in an upscale neighborhood, is very easy to reach from the airport/train stations and from there it's fast to get to all the main attractions and sights. On my first day I took a walk from her place to Vatican City and on my way experienced the most wonderful overlook of Rome from Gianicolo Park. I will never forget this amazing vacation thanks to my wonderful host Simona.  On a scale from 1 to 5, she gets a 10. "
49206,32902969,2015-05-23,11044617,Barbara,"This AirBnb was recommended to me by a friend who had raved about it. I was not disappointed. Simona was a fabulous, caring, knowledgeable host! She is a proud Roman who knows, loves, and shares her city well. Her gracious hospitality was a lovely start to each day with freshly brewed coffee, juices, continental breakfast, AND the opportunity to ask questions, get directions and suggestions for the day. 
The room was clean, spacious, with comfortable bed, and automatic  
metal roller shades that gave darkness for good sleeping. The bath was beautiful with bidet and jacuzzi tub and lovely thick towels which she changed often. 

Simona's  friendliness and attention to detail were extraordinary. She even arranged a car to take me to the airport at very late notice AND suggested a short train trip off the beaten tourist path to see a castle which turned out to be a highlight of my time in Rome. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to others. 

I agree with a previous review, we need to have more stars available to give this location and lovely  10 stars!"

49206,33613630,2015-05-30,29684511,Felicia,"""Mama"" , we called her, is a precious woman. She really made us feel at home and the furnishing of her home gives one a really authentic feel. The sofa bed I was very skeptical of at first but was the best nights sleep I've had in Italy. Surprisingly! And for both of us too. The down side to this place is the location. We got quite lost and confused the first day with the tram,bus, metro system to trastevere center and back and on the second day we learned buses stopped at midnight and we had to take a taxi home about 20 euros. Not a close walk to rome center. The other thing is there's no shower but a bathtub instead and all 4 times we've tried to shower in the bath tub the water has gone from piping hot to cold and alternating back and forth on it's own without us touching it. We didn't have 1 good shower while we were there unfortunately despite the efforts mama tried to show us that the water was fine. Other than that we enjoyed our talks and recommendations we got from mama. She was a good host with a lively personality but just be weary of shower and plan your transportation wisely!!"
49206,33996339,2015-06-03,30236150,Nina,"We could not have asked for a better host than Simona. Not only were the room and bathroom very comfortable and always clean, returning to Casa di Simona at night felt like returning home. Though it wasn't near any of the big attractions, the walk home at the end of the day was quiet and relaxing. Simona helped us plan our itineraries each day, and she was able to provide insight on how to navigate the public transportation of the city, which was a little difficult. Though we were excited to continue traveling in another city, we were sad to say goodbye to Simona! This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had! "
49206,34208561,2015-06-06,30176830,Natalia,"Simona was a wonderful hostess: she was very attentive, charming, available, and offered great suggestions to suit our interests, including her beliefs about what is truly Roman. We were really grateful for these suggestions and her hospitality. The room was clean, comfortable, and close to public transit into the historic centre but far enough from the chaos of tourism. Grazie, Simona!"
49206,34637408,2015-06-10,3586447,Aaron,"Simona's apartment was excellent; immaculately clean, spacious, tastefully decorated and very well-located. Simona herself is a gem, a Roman by birth, vivacious, gracious, charming and knowledgable about her city. The room was spacious and comfortable. Central Rome is pretty intense and we enjoyed the location of Simona's apartment which was close-but not too-close. Coming back to Simona's elegant apartment at the end if a day's sightseeing was a true pleasure as were our conversations with the hostess. Recommend highly."
49206,34865740,2015-06-13,31099809,Nick,"Simona was a very good host! Every morning and night, she took time to talk to us about our plans and made recommendations. All of her recommendations turned out to be great and I would recommend listening to her advice! She also serves a breakfast of bread and jam with coffee to help get your day started. 

The room was in a very nice location in Trastevere. It is a short walk from Gianicolo hill, which provided an amazing view of the city. I recommend going during the day for the best view. There are also many restaurants within a short walk of the room. Using public transportation, getting into the city is very easy and Simona can give you all the details. If you prefer to walk it is about 3.5 miles to get to the city center. 

The room itself is very nice. It could fit up to three people comfortably (2 in the bed and 1 on the couch). Some of the decorations were a little scary, but it had more than enough space for all of our bags. The bathroom is a short walk across the halls (the rooms she rents are completely separated from her house by a sliding door). The bathroom has a large sink and a drying rack, however it does not have a shower. There is a sprayer, but there is no shower curtain and it has very little water pressure. Also the water seemed to fluctuate from very hot to very cold.

Additionally, if you are leaving by plane Simona offers to have a Mercedes pick you up and take you to the airport. Although it is a very nice gesture, the cost of the Mercedes is 50 euros. If your flight is super early then I recommend you take it, but if it is later in the afternoon I recommend you take public transportation or find a taxi in the city for cheaper.

Note: Be very careful when getting into the bed. One night, while attempting to get on the bed I accidentally broke one of the boards underneath. It cost me 15 euros to get the bed fixed and I was very embarrassed. Lay down very carefully!

Overall, great location and kind host!"
49206,35030646,2015-06-14,22077544,Erin,"Simona is an amazing host! She is very kind, has a lot of information about Rome, and is passionate about being an Air BNB host. She was very communicative and prompt with her responses. The place is a pleasant hike from Trastevere- it's very residential so it gives you a better feel of Rome living. The room is big and very clean with all basic amenities. The breakfast is also very nice -good coffee and juice, pastries, and yogurt. If I'm ever back in Rome I will definitely plan on staying with Simona again! "
49206,35299800,2015-06-17,31158565,Hui,"This is my first time that I book airbnb alone. I am a bit disappointed that 40â¬ per night while there is no shower - it's quite hot and no shower means I can't wash my hair - I have long and thick hair... Luckily another girl booked another room allowed me to take shower in her bathroom.

I was told that I did not choose the right room (double room) that equipped with a shower. So just to remind following travellers, if you book alone, make sure you ask for the double room which has a separate toilet with shower. Otherwise, automatically, the single room will be booked for you. You can take bath, but not after 11pm. For hair wash, maybe in the basin if you don't have long hair...

The room is beside the road, and is a bit noisy. Good thing is that Simona stays in the flat all the time, would like to talk to you and answer any questions you have, for example where to go and how to get there. 
"
49206,35602080,2015-06-20,34709824,Joo Kyung,"Simona is a sweet and caring lady. She always asked what I wanted to do and tried to help me all the time. Her place was a lovely place with nice balconies. Room was spacious and clean. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay in Rome. "
49206,36382325,2015-06-28,31471219,Ciaran,"Simona is a lovely and caring woman who goes to every length to make sure her guests are cared for. She prepared breakfast for us every day and always helped us with directions and things to see. Her apartment is spacious and clean, and the bed is very comfortable! The apartment is just outside of Rome, but Trastevere is a great and lively area where you can see the 'real' Rome. We would definitely stay with Simona again! "
49206,37535419,2015-07-07,30619911,Honey,"Simona regularly asked where I wanted to go so she could give me directions. She allowed me to use her refrigerator to store some food. The first day I arrived at Simona's house, she welcomed me to breakfast and an espresso. 

I had difficulty opening the front door, due to the different (""old fashioned"") key. Simona was kind enough to open the door for me when I arrived home. The fan in the bedroom rattled on the desk/table in the bedroom, and fell on the ground. I immediately informed Simona about this. Her response was that it was impossible for the fan to rattle and move the distance that it did. Some comments that Simona made during my stay made me feel rather uncomfortable to speak up about something. However, on my last evening at Simona's house, I enjoyed the conversation that we had. Although Simona and I didn't see eye to eye on several things, she was readily available to help with tourist things. She even gave me lavender oil to use while I took a bath, and gave me a cooking pot to use to wash my hair in the bathtub. 

Generally speaking, Simona is a good host, and her home is clean and tidy.  "
49206,38450436,2015-07-15,37815788,Beth,"Simona is a fantastic host!! This was my first time using airbnb and after my experiences with Simona I will definitely use airbnb again! I highly recommend Simona and her apartment.

In the morning, Simona prepares a typical Roman breakfast (cornetti, bread, yogurt, espresso/tea) at whatever time suits you. I don't eat bread so Simona was happy to prepare an alternate breakfast for me. She was very accommodating with my food restrictions - this was kind of her and it made me feel very welcome.

I spent a semester in Rome during University so I am fairly familiar with the city. Simona suggested a few places to visit that I didn't know about - and they were all beautiful! She is very happy to set up tours and other services that you may need. And you should take her up on this offer because making a reservation over the phone will cost less than making a reservation online.

The apartment itself is lovely and the single room is spacious with a comfortable twin bed and a big desk (I love that desk). The bathroom is outside the bedroom, but just two steps away and it has an amazing jacuzzi tub. After a long day of traveling or sight seeing it is so relaxing and the jets on your feet are a real treat!

The apartment is conveniently located just South of Trastevere and very close to the Janiculum Hill. It is easy to get to the historic center from the apartment - by either bus + tram or train + metro - depending where you want to go. I tend to prefer the bus + tram which takes you to Largo Argentina (so close to Campo de' Fiori/Pantheon/Piazza Navona/Jewish Ghetto) or Piazza Venezia (Vittorio Emanuele Monument/Campodoglio/Trajan's Forum).

I am very happy with my decision to stay at Simona's apartment. I would very happily stay here again and I will recommend Simona to all my friends who visit Rome."
49206,38859334,2015-07-19,20688867,Reila,"Simona gave us clear direction on how to get to the apartment. Although it wasn't located at the centre of Rome, it was quite easy to get to all the attractions. The room was spacious and very clean. Simona was a lovely host. She prepared breakfast and made us very good cappuccinos (we love that!). The room was a bit hot during the night, and we would prefer a shower than a bath, but other than that the stay was perfect :) "
49206,40044303,2015-07-27,33065094,Kiera,Great location. Very easy to get into Rome and other places of interest. Lovely host who had excellent local knowledge and suggested lovely things to do. I would definitely stay here again. 
49206,40343002,2015-07-30,13062217,Giulia,"I spent 3 nights at Simonaâs place. The apartment is spacious, well-equipped and clean ( first floor with lift). The area is quiete and safe also late in the night. No problems for those who travel alone. Simona made me feel welcomed. She gave me lots of information about the city and the means of public transportation. Roma is a big city and if you want to  see all the attractions you have to cover long distance. I suggest to next guests to use the bus nÂ° 8 to reach the city center (  15 minutes walk   to reach the bus stop at Piazzale Dunant and about 25 minutes to reach Piazzale Araceli). If you are interested in San Pietro area get the train (4 minutes) and the bus nÂ° 64 ( 10 minutes).If you want to skip the line you must be there at 8 oâclock in the morning otherwise you will queque all the day long! As well for Musei Vaticani and Capella Sistina.  I really loved Trastevere expecially during the night ( try the restaurant  GINO 51 and the tuscan ham store LA PROSCIUTTERIA). Roma is a wounderful city even with the crasy traffic jam 
You can not find a cheapest B&B in Roma, so if you look for a budget accomodation, choose Simonaâs B&B 
"
49206,40768679,2015-08-02,2186824,Katrina,"We were so lucky to be able to stay with Simona!

Simona is the most thoughtful host - she truly made our time in Rome such a perfect experience. She tailored a wonderful itinerary and suggestions for us that included great local meals, views and beautiful walks. We feel as though we had a truly authentic experience because of her.

The apartment is gorgeous - the room had so much space and Simona prepared us a simple breakfast (with as much espresso as we needed!) each morning.

Thank you Simona for your wonderful hospitality. We will be back!
"
49206,44063019,2015-08-23,3458575,Oli,"Where to begin! I had a fantastic stay with Simona - perhaps the best in 3 years of Airbnb-ing. She really looks after you, providing everything you need to be comfortable, a great breakfast, interesting conversation, and even offered to take my clothes to the laundrette while I was out during the day! The room itself was spotless, had a comfortable bed, and a powerful fan to combat the summer heat. The bathroom is a standard I'd expect to find at a hotel, not an apartment! The area has good transport links and a variety of restaurants within walking distance. I would definitely stay again. Thank you, Simona!"

Simona hat sich als ganz herzliche, freundliche und hilfsbereite Person erwiesen. Sie hat mir das GefÃ¼hl vermittelt ein willkommener Gast zu sein, als ob ich schon seit Jahren ein Freund wÃ¤re. Simona war sehr fÃ¼rsorglich und hat mir viele wertvolle Tipps Ã¼ber Rom gegeben. Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber, immer perfekt aufgerÃ¤umt und lediglich 2-3 hundert Meter von der S-Bahn-Station Quatro Venti entfernt. Ich habe mein Aufenthalt bei Simona sehr genossen und wÃ¼rde mich sehr freuen sie eines Tages wiederzusehen. FÃ¼r diesen angenehmen Aufenthaltsort und vor allem fÃ¼r diese wunderbare Gastgeberin kann ich vom Herzen nur die besten Empfehlungen aussprechen. 

P.S. Meine lebhafte Kommunikation mit meiner Gastgeberin hat in dem MaÃ zur Verbesserung meiner Sprachkenntnissen beigetragen, dass ich mir nun zutraue auch eine Rezension in italienischen Sprache abzugeben. 

Ho trascorso a Roma due settimane molto piacevoli. Nella casa di mia ospita mi ho sentito in mio agio dal primo giorno. Simona si Ã¨ dimostrata come una persona molto simpatica, gentilissima e disponibile. Ã una donna colta, educata e aperta. Mi ha dato lâimpressione di essere un ospite benvenuto, come se fossi da tanti anni un amico. Simona Ã¨ molto premurosa, ama la sua cittÃ  e mi ha dato un sacco di consigli preziosi. La casa era pulitissima e in perfetto ordine, a due passi dalla stazione Quattro venti. Insomma mi sono goduto un soggiorno piacevolissimo e mi piacerebbe tanto rivedere Simona un giorno. Non posso altro che raccomandare cordialmente questa bella sistemazione e soprattutto questa stupenda ospita. Non mi sono mai trovato cosi bene a casa di estranei! Grazie mille per tutto!

Simona es una persona amable y cercana que te hace sentirte como en tu casa y ademÃ¡s habla castellano perfectamente.

She gave us a map and drew a detailed route for us to every sight we told her we wanted to see, wrote down which buses to get, and gave us her (Hidden by Airbnb) number just in case we needed to reach her at any time.  Simona truly loves Rome, and our trip would not have been nearly as amazing without her. If I ever get to go back to Rome, I will stay with her again!"

During our staying we asked so many questions and got detailed advices.   Every morning she kindly called a taÑi  for us  â the cheapest one..    we always felt Simonaâs care. 

The house is located not in the center. But it was easy to get back home by train â the station is in a three minute walk. Just pay attention that  you need to change the subway to train because there is no metro in this part of the city. Look at  the scheme of  subway and trains  and everything will be clear))

We got maps and some tourist information from her and she gave us many advices how to create our holiday. We had a nice breakfast every morning that Simona prepared for us at the time we wished and the rooms were very clean and tidy.

Bello il quartiere, ubicato ad un passo dal centro e ben servito dai mezzi: la stazione di Quattro Venti Ã¨ fra Trastevere e San Pietro, si puÃ² quindi arrivare dovunque in breve tempo.

Per chi volesse pranzare o cenare in zona, ottimo il ristorante Quattro Venti, vicinissimo.

She knows a lot about Rome and the neighbourhood and had great suggestions.  The apartment is clean and beautiful and well situated. You can stay in a quiet safe neighbourhood yet be in the center of Rome in just a few minutes. Highly recommended!"

Although the bathroom is not inside the room, it's only a few steps across a small hall and you basically get that all to yourself!

In terms of a planned itinerary, I didn't really have one. However, Simona was gracious enough to organize my entire stay in Rome. She provides a helpful map and asks you what your interests are. If you like art and history, she will recommend the museums/churches to check out. If you want to experience Italy's finest cuisine, she will recommend the best pasta and pizzeria places especially where the locals go. If you just want to get lost and explore Rome, she will recommend the places to walk around and Simona will say to you, ""You will see Rome through Roman eyes"" :) Also, if you really want to live like a Roman while you're there, Simona will make you the perfect Roman breakfast every morning: a cappuccino and a cornetto (obviously at your request)!

Overall, my stay was excellent! If I can give a 100 stars I would! I highly recommend staying with Simona and it's only a matter of time when I will stay with her again on my next visit out there."

49206,68979161,2016-04-08,7400018,Francesca,"My staying at Simona's has been incredible: she organised for me a pick up from the airport directly to her beautiful apartment and she was very flexible checking in one unexpected guest who stayed with me one night. The room was very bright, confortable and cozy. Simona's apartment is beautiful, full of her personality and decorated with taste.
Simona was the perfect host, very friendly and welcoming, with a bubbly personality: we had a very pleasant chat one evening on her terrace and she has lots of interesting anedoctes and stories to entertain her guests.
Totally recommended!!!!"
49206,71131591,2016-04-23,35463236,Christina,Simona is the most gracious and welcoming host. Our Italian honeymoon starting in Rome could not have been more perfect thanks to her hospitality. My husband and I enjoyed a true Roma experience with Simona's authentic restaurant recommendations and guidance with sightseeing for the most beautiful parts of the city. I will recommend Simona to my friends and family! 
49206,72727682,2016-05-04,27804396,"Sol, Pedro Y Amalia","Simona es una excelente anfitriona. Su apartamento es muy acogedor y encuentras todo lo que necesitas. Es un placer tomar el desayuno y disfrutar de sus conversas. Realmente se disfruta su compaÃ±Ã­a y hospitalidad. 
Recomendamos ampliamente su hospedaje no sÃ³lo por Simona sino por la ubicaciÃ³n,  las condiciones del apartamento,  todas las indicaciones que te brinda y la facilidad del idioma. Â¡Muchas gracias por todo!"
49206,73412396,2016-05-08,26119399,Carina,"Monteverde and Simonas home was a perfect spot where from explore Rome! Simona is a real organizer and will have someone to pick you up at the airport if that is what you want. 

Take the tram 8 from Plaza Venezia to the near by block or just get off in Trastevere (the stop before) and walk. Trastevere is the best place to enjoy the roman neighborhood and Monteverde is a beautiful district just adjacent to Trastevere. You can also take the train from Quattro Verde to St Pauls, and therefor walk a few blocks to The Vatican. If you're not up for a walk, there's also bus 64 straight outside St Pauls stop to The Vatican.

Simona has two rooms to rent, both with private bathrooms. Cleaning is spotless and Simona is really accurate of that the guests are comfortable and happy with the resident. Quiet and harmonious, away from the 20000 other tourists wondering around in the City Center of Rome ;). Buy your tickets in the kiosk nearby the train stop, cause it could be difficult to find places to by in the City. One ride (100 min) is 1,50 euros. By a few at the same time and make sure you'll be ok for a few rides.

Simona will wake up early and make sure you have something to eat before you leave for the adventure of the day. Ske bakes her own bread and makes you coffee every morning. She will help you find your way around Rome and will tell you what's worth while.

I am very happy to have met this wonderful lady and will consider her as a friend for the rest of my life."
49206,73939985,2016-05-11,13064692,Cecile,"J'ai passÃ© un trÃ¨s agrÃ©able sÃ©jour chez Simona. L'appartement est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et Simona est une personne chaleureuse et trÃ¨s accueillante. Elle connait trÃ¨s bien sa ville et m'a donnÃ© des conseils trÃ¨s utiles pour organiser mes journÃ©es de visite. On se sent comme Ã  la maison chez elle.

We had all the intimacy we needed, including our private bathroom, and at the same time she was always there to provide us with information and useful tips if necessary."
49206,77081848,2016-05-30,68754165,Nick,"My girlfriend and I both enjoyed our experience with Simona. In our opinion, this BnB is perfect for a short stay in Rome for young people. It is about a mile walk to some of the best restaurants in Trastevere, and is in a nice quiet location that provides an escape from that ""touristy"" feel. Simona is a good motherly figure that is concerned about your stay, and truly does want to make your stay enjoyable. We also enjoyed her breakfasts; she provided us with Nutella and orange juice, along with a mix of other breakfasty things every morning, not to mention her delicious home-made bread! She is also decently close to the Trastevere train station, which means that if you are looking for a cheap way to get to the BnB from the airport or the Termini train station, the train is one of your best bets. She can also provide good recommendations for food in the area. You will have a wonderful experience if you book with Simona!"

Arrivederci presto Simona!
Lucia  "
49206,78688893,2016-06-08,66144733,Kellie,"We had an incredible stay at Simona's place. She truly is a super host! She treated us to traditional Italian breakfast every morning, and made sure we had the best advice daily for where to eat and where to visit so we got the most out of our trip. It was great to have a true local's perspective. The bedroom and bathroom were clean, spacious and comfortable. The area itself, Trastevere, whilst still quite active, was much quieter than central Rome and had a lot less tourists. If you're looking to get away from it all, I highly suggest you make the 30 minute walk to the local park, Villa Doria Pamphili. It was so peaceful and there is plenty to have a look at as you make your way around the place. It was just people going about their daily lives, which was refreshing after a busy day sightseeing. To get to the Rome's main attractions it was anywhere from a 5 minute to 45 minute commute depending on whether you walked, or took the bus, tram, or train - all of which are quite easy to figure out with Simona's guidance. Overall our first Airbnb experience was above all our expectations. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Rome wanting a bit more of a local vibe. Hoping to return soon! Grazie, ciao!"
49206,79293966,2016-06-12,29631174,Hui Ting,"Simona is an excellent host! She was warm, friendly, helpful and made us feel at home the moment we stepped into her house. Throughout our stay, we felt more like her relatives who were visiting rather than strangers who were putting up at her house via the airbnb arrangement. We were pleasantly surprised by the home made bread she baked personally alongside other bread that were available for our breakfast. After Simona heard us telling her how much we loved the jam she provided, she even gave us a bottle to bring along for our next leg to Florence! The room was big and clean! There were three of us staying in one room and there were more than enough space for us to sleep and put our luggages.  Simona also gave us privacy when needed but was always there when we needed any help or advice. The location is accessible to the town centre via a 20 mins walk plus 20 mins tram ride. It is a stop away from Vatican City so great location! One small challenge we had was with the hot water tap as there were some repairs to be done which Simona was unable to complete  yet because of our stay. It was challenging to get the right temperature due to the faulty tap. Once that is fixed up, it would be a real perfect stay! I would strongly recommend Simona's place to stay if you are coming by Rome! :)"
49206,85036710,2016-07-10,20371309,Pasquale,"Simona mette a disposizione dei suoi ospiti una sistemazione eccellente, all'interno di un appartamento accogliente, luminoso e rifinito con ottimo gusto. 
Il parquet, le pareti smaltate con vernice ad acqua, l'arredamento a metÃ  tra il classico d'autore e il design moderno contribuiscono a rendere la casa un nido confortevole al quale ci si affeziona velocemente e dal quale si va via a malincuore.  
La sistemazione, all'interno di un'ampia stanza ariosa e dotata di ogni comfort, Ã¨ stata perfettamente in grado di aderire  alle mie esigenze di riposo e tranquillitÃ , durante il soggiorno a Roma. 
Letto comodissimo, ampi spazi di appoggio per vestiti e oggetti personali, tv, balconcino privato, ventilatore potente ed efficace azionabile con telecomando,  restando stesi a letto . 
La possibilitÃ  di usare, a richiesta, la cucina contribuisce a sentirsi pienamente a proprio agio. 
Di gran pregio il bagno, a uso esclusivo e collocato difronte alla stanza, completamente rifinito in marmo e dotato di tutte le comoditÃ  necessarie, tra le quali spicca  la vasca idromassaggio, una vera perla che contribuisce a rendere speciale la permanenza da Simona. 
La sensazione piÃ¹ immediata che si prova soggiornando da Simona Ã¨ certamente quella di sentirisi sinceramente accolti. 
Lo si avverte, per esempio, la mattina appena svegli, davanti alla splendida e ricca colazione allestita con premura, impreziosita dal pane preparato da Simona e dalla possibilitÃ  di restare a chiacchierare con lei, sorseggiando un caffÃ¨. 
Del resto, credo sia questa la vera ""grande bellezza"" che il soggiorno da Simona rivela: la possibilitÃ  di lasciarsi abbracciare da una casa romana bellissima, governata da una persona che ama condividere la sua fortissima romanitÃ , arricchendola, in uno scambio continuo di esperienze e dialoghi. 
Tutto da Simona parla di Roma. 
L'appartamento, infatti, Ã¨ strategicamente collocato in un bel palazzo residenziale, a pochi passi dalla Stazione di Quattro Venti, a due minuti in treno da Trastevere e da San Pietro, zona servita benissimo anche dai bus. 
Intorno, i lunghi viali e le salite del Quartiere Monteverde, invitano alle passeggiate e all'esplorazione in un ambiente tranquillo, profumato dell'odore degli alberi, dotato di ogni genere di negozi, supermercati, ristoranti e, soprattutto, vicinissimo alle attrazioni piÃ¹ significative di Roma. 
A piedi, per esempio, Ã¨ raggiungibile Villa Doria Pamphili, un polmone verde nel quale rilassarsi, per esempio d'estate nelle ore piÃ¹ calde.
CiÃ² che stupisce, inoltre, Ã¨ la possibilitÃ  di scoprire con facilitÃ  luoghi di grandissimo pregio artistico, culturale e storico, spesso sottovalutati dal turismo di massa, posti a pochi passi da casa di Simona. 
Lei, infatti, Ã¨ un'ottima conoscitrice dei luoghi romani e non perde occasione per suggerirne la loro scoperta.  
Consiglierei a chiunque di soggiornare da Simona; le foto e le descrizioni dell'annuncio corrispondono alla realtÃ  e, anzi, per certi versi non rendono esattamente l'idea della bellezza rara di questo luogo.  
La spiccata intelligenza, anche emotiva, della quale Ã¨ dotata Simona la rende perfettamente assorbita in un ambiente che la rispecchia in pieno: accogliente, di classe, romano.

Just like home away from home, Simona's hospitality is a cut above the rest in comparison to other hostels and Airbnbs we stayed at during our trip. She is always available to help you out, and is such a genuinely kind and generous lady. Sad to leave her again, but will definitely return whenever I am back in Rome!"

49206,99916292,2016-09-06,10489722,Rafael,"Simona es la mejor anfitriona de Airbnb que he conocido (y no son pocos los lugares donde me he alojado). Ella representa lo que un anfitriÃ³n de Airbnb debe ser, no solo dejarte las llaves y darte algunas indicaciones sobre cÃ³mo funciona la ducha, sino hacerte sentir en casa durante tu estadÃ­a. Acabo de regresar de 15 dÃ­as en Europa y es probable que algunos de los mejores momentos del viaje hayan sido los desayunos con esta entraÃ±able mujer de 72 aÃ±os, con la dedicaciÃ³n suficiente para prepararte todos los dÃ­as el desayuno (si es que uno quiere desayunar allÃ­) y mantener una charla contigo mientras tomas un exquisito cafÃ© con pan casero. Su casa, hermosa, amplia, cÃ³moda, en Monteverde Vecchio, un barrio muy lindo, muy cerca de Trastevere (donde estÃ¡n todos los bares y boliches) y tambiÃ©n cerca de la zona del Coliseo y de la del Vaticano. Ultra recomendable. "
49206,100855058,2016-09-11,31220089,Chris,"Simply spectacular! This was my first experience using a private room because I usually opt to for the ""Entire Home/Apt"" option, but I was completely blown away by the service. This is an actual 'BnB.' The host, Simone, is super friendly, contacts you and responds very quickly, was very welcoming, gives you a map and suggestions for how to get around the city, and she even prepares a light breakfast and espresso every morning. In case you don't speak Italian, like myself, she speaks English and Spanish well. The location itself is not in any particular tourist hotspot, but it's very close to a metro station, so moving around the city is easy, but if you're like me and enjoy walking, you can walk to anywhere in the city, especially Trastevere, which is probably my favorite neighborhood in Rome.

El apartamento es hermoso, amplio y muy comodo. La cama es muy comfortable y el baÃ±o esta perfecto.
La ubicacion es muy buena a solo unos metros del tren, que conecta con el vaticano, termini, tiburtina ,y el aeropuerto, entre otros. Ademas hay conexion de bus al centro antiguo.El barrio en si es hermoso, residencial h muy bonito.

Elle s'est occupÃ©e de moi comme si j'Ã©tais sa fille et je n'ai jamais Ã©tÃ© autant Ã  l'aise avec quelqu'un aussi vite. Tout Ã©tais comme une Ã©vidence avec elle. Je me levais et elle Ã©tait lÃ  aux petits soins, puis aprÃ¨s le cafÃ©, elle me dÃ©posais ou m'enmenais me montrer des coins magnifiques de Rome. Ce n'est pas seulement un logement impÃ©cable et propre qu'elle vous propose mais une douce thÃ©rapie romaine menÃ©e par un ange venu du ciel. C'est comme si vous ressortez de chez elle tout neuf et que votre vision de la vie Ã  changÃ©e. Je n'ai jamais connue une hÃ´te aussi passionnÃ©e et superbe.

Don't hesitate and stay with Simona!"
49206,144021773,2017-04-14,74756487,Dilara,"Simona is the greatest host you can find in Rome. As an experienced Roma traveller, I honestly say that Simona's place is the best one you can ever find in Rome. 
Firstly, Simona's home is in a very quite and safe area but also very close to the historical centre. And it is also very easy to access public transportations if you don't prefer to walk. By the way it is extremely easy to go to Simona's place from airport with train which is very important for me.
Apart from Simona's infinite hospitality you can find everything what you expect including perfectly clean and comfortable room and bathroom, delicious breakfast with coffee and a cheerful host. Honestly, I don't want to call Simona as my host, she is a careful, and respectful friend, lives and shares her joyful life with her guests.

While not in central-Rome, it is convenient to the train station and only a 5 minute ride to Trastevere.  I would recommend this location for someone who is looking to have a relaxing Roman-eque weekend of visiting cafes, and taking walks without the hoards of tourists that flock to the center.  There are many beautiful sites within walking distance including a fountain and overlook which Simona happily took me to.  Simona also is very passionate about hosting and is a warm and attentive host who is happy to call restaurants or help you in anyway needed."

Grace Ã  Simona  et ses conseils inÃ©dits, jâai pu voir et goÃ»ter Rome dans lâesprit du voyageur et non pas celui du touriste qui court dâun monument vers lâautre sans jamais rien voir. Jâai pu voir les perles de la ville, loin des endroits prisÃ©s par la foule. 
En effet comment est-ce possible de rattraper plus de vingt-huit siÃ¨cles dâexistence dâune ville qui contient tant de beautÃ©, en termes dâart, dâarchitecture, dâarchÃ©ologie, de cuisine et dâart de vivre ? 
Rome se vit comme le dit si bien Simona, et cela veut dire visiter la ville en prenant son rythme et en se donnant le temps de la savourer sous ses aspects multiples. Câest apprentissage de Simona, qui mâa permis de me dÃ©lester dÃ©finitivement de la boulimie des touristes qui ne font quâeffleurer du regard toute cette majestÃ©, pour adopter lâesprit du voyageur qui vit la ville, la goÃ»te et la voit rÃ©ellement. 
Simona est une hÃ´tesse unique, Ã©patante par sa chaleur, sa culture et son amour de Rome quâelle communique si bien. Par bien des Ã©gards, Simona est Rome. Et grÃ¢ce Ã  AIRBNB je pense avoir gagnÃ© une amie et un lien dont cette premiÃ¨re visite nâa Ã©tÃ© que le commencement.
Merci infiniment Ã  Simona pour se sÃ©jour unique, je reviendrai pour le reste du programme et surtout, jâespÃ¨re que tu viendras me rendre visite au Maroc.

See you soon ,your friend Michel."
49206,153022083,2017-05-19,24915568,Kaushik,"Simona has a great place in Monte Verde that is easily accessible by train, with the main station just a couple of minutes away. She is a great host who makes you feel at home. The breakfast is pretty simple and well laid out. Simona helps with breakfast herself. She even offered to get something for us from her supermarket visit. 

Simona helped us with places to visit and with public transportation information as required.  Trastevere is a few minutes from Simona's place - easy to get to in a couple of stops. 

We had easy connectivity to all places and Rome from Simona's place, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a friendly and gracious host. "

Ho scelto il suo appartamento perchÃ© giÃ  ho conosciuto il quartiere di Monteverde Vecchio, che per me Ã¨ il piÃ¹ speciale di tutta la cittÃ . Che bellissima sorpresa trovare una padrona cosÃ¬ amichevole, piena di consigli per avere una esperienza vera romana, in un appartamento decorato con tutte le cose squisite nella vita: da libri a opere d'arte, da bei tappeti a mobili da legno fatti con dettagli splendidi. Ma da tutta questa bellezza, ho trovato che la cosa piÃ¹ speciale, piÃ¹ notevole del soggiorno con Simona Ã¨ stata le nostre conversazioni. Sempre ha parlato con me volentieri in italiano, che mi aiuta molto migliorare, sui temi molto profondi della vita, e Ã¨ in pochi giorni giÃ  diventata per me una delle persone piÃ¹ importanti per me che ho mai incontrato in tutti i miei viaggi in Italia (e ne ho fatto tanti perchÃ© studio la storia dell'arte romana per il mio lavoro!). L'amicizia e il cuore ben aperto di Simona sono delle cose piÃ¹ straordinari da scoprire nella CittÃ  Eterna."

Because of all her tips & advice you really get to experience the ""roman lifestyle"". Every morning she made me breakfast and then she helped me to make a plan for the day,what locations to visit,how to get there etc.
The house is located near public transportation,2 min from trainstation & busstop and about 7-10 min from the tram,so it is easy to get to anywhere in the city.
And after a long day of exploring the city it's great to come back to Simona's beautiful home.

Mi sono sentita a casa e coccolata, Simona Ã¨ una persona colta, gentile, educata e di compagnia. Ogni giorno mi ha consigliato un itinerario, mi ha dato delle dritte sui mezzi (a due passi da casa si ferma l'autobus 982  e c'Ã©  la stazione  Quattro Venti). Oltre a tutto questo il valore aggiunto sono state le chiacchierate a colazione e la sera al mio ritorno.

Thank you, Ermanno!"
49240,281735,2011-05-26,348400,Jeannette,"When we arrived there was no electricity in the building. Ermanno offered to move us to another apartment later in the evening but the electricity came back on after 9 hours. The apartment could use some upgrading. The facet in the half bath didn't work, there was no shower curtain around the tub, there wasn't a trash can in the kitchen, one morning we had ants on the sink and the TV didn't work. The location was central to historic Rome but was in a noisy area; above a motorcycle shop and construction nearby. Ermanno was a good host and available when we needed him. If you are coming from the airport it is very easy to get to the apartment by taking the train to the Trastevere station and then taking the #8 electric tram to Argentine Square. You can easily walk the two blocks to the apartment."
49240,588207,2011-10-02,595368,Joel,"Ermanno was a great host.  I stayed at the Pantheon apartment , with my wife, son,  and daughter from Sept. 24- Oct. 1 , 2011.  He helped us in every way possible from pick up at the airport to suggestions on what to do, see, and places to eat..  The apartment is in the perfect location,  right by the Pantheon and Piazza Navona.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience.  It is a great place with all the accomodations of home."
49240,707175,2011-11-10,987155,Stephen,"I can't claim to have stayed in this particular apartment as it was flooded the day before I arrived in Rome. Ermano attemped to let us know about the situation before we got there but without an internet connection while in transit we showed up none-the-wiser. Before we'd even got out the cab we were on our way to the substitute apartment Ermano had managed to arrange. It was only five or so mins away from the previous flat and more importantly still only a short walk from the Pantheon. I have to give it to Ermano he really came through for us, disaster was averted, the new flat was great and we had a fantastic time in Rome. Thanks Ermano.
"
49240,804382,2011-12-24,939151,June,"When we arrived in Rome and called Ermanno about meeting us at the apartment, we were told there was a mistake in the booking and were given another apartment in another building a few blocks from this one.  It was smaller and not what we wanted but we had no choice since we didn't get there until after 6pm.  This apartment rented for less than the one we booked but we were not compensated for the difference.  (I noticed one other guest had this same thing happen to them so beware).  It was in a good location, just not what we expected or paid for."

49240,4147756,2013-04-14,5184269,Edith,"TrÃ¨s bon accueil d'Ermanno dans cet appartement idÃ©alement situÃ©, prÃ¨s du PanthÃ©on. 
L'appartement est trÃ¨s propre, logeable,avec un mobilier suffisant. 
La terrasse commune de l'immeuble permet de passer de bons moments au soleil. Elle est juste au-dessus de l'appartement, qui, lui, n'est pas trÃ¨s clair car situÃ© dans une rue Ã©troite, mais pleine de charme. On trouve de nombreuses boutiques autour, les bus sont tout prÃ¨s, mais on peut aussi dÃ©couvrir tout Rome ou presque Ã  pied en partant de l'appartement.
Seule mauvaise surprise : l'isolation phonique de l'appartement n'est pas suffisante pour Ã©viter le bruit des conversations tardives dans la rue. Une sortie arriÃ¨re d'un club-restaurant sous les fenÃªtres de l'appartement occasionne des nuisances trÃ¨s tard dans la nuit (jusqu'Ã  3 ou 4h du matin), plusieurs fois par semaine. Ce sont seulement les fumeurs qui sortent le temps d'une cigarette et qui parlent, (pas de musique), mais c'est gÃªnant. 
Ermanno est un hÃ´te trÃ¨s sympathique et accueillant. Il nous a fourni toute une liste de bonnes adresses et s'est arrangÃ© pour que notre sÃ©jour soit aussi agrÃ©able que possible.

We would definitely recommend this place, although it does look a bit nicer on the pictures! The location is perfect and the place nice and quiet ! :)"

We did not get the apartment we originally booked but Ermanno offered us a different place he had available which was very nice, very roomy, and was in a very good location!  Ermanno also arranged transportation to and from the Airport for our family (5 people plus luggage) at a reasonable rate.  He also helped up on very short notice."
49240,33261876,2015-05-26,30592643,Josie,"we where going to stay in the Pantheon apartment but when i contacted Ermanno the flat was no longer available.  the lease had been revoked.  He found another place for us to stay looking over the Trevi fountain ""TREVI FOUNTAIN with TERRIFIC VIEW"".   This place was fantastic.  So close to everything.  Very cute place and once the windows where shut very quite.  it was great looking out the window watching the everyone go by.   Ermanno organised a taxi to and from the airport which was great.  He also txt one in Rome to check everything was ok.  "
49240,63009465,2016-02-19,57106142,Oneyda,"The apartment is in an exceptional location. Approximately a block from the Pantheon. The apartment itself was nice and clean. It was exactly as advertised and will comfortably sleep 5 people. Ermanno was extremely helpful, an excellent host, and met us at the apartment on our arrival. He walked us in and explained the door locks (different from what we are use to) and showed us the apartment. He also told us some restaurants to try, and told us what buses to take to the sights, and where to catch them. It is a great place, centrally located, within easy walking distance of all the major attractions.  The only down side is there is a night club across from the apartment and it can be noisy certain nights. "
49240,68437661,2016-04-05,43784678,Gloria,"We had a wonderful stay at Ermanno's apartment in Rome.  He arranged for our transportation from the airport and met us at the apartment.  Spent time showing us around the area and treated us to our first cup of espresso!

We are an adult family of 5 and this apartment suited us comfortably.  The location was excellent for shopping, sightseeing and restaurants....you can walk to just about everything and the bus stop was only a few blocks away for when you don't want to walk.

We were exhausted from travel on our first night's stay and slept with windows open but the next few nights realized that being in the city center, there was noise from the street below and closed the windows and shutters (I used my headphones because I live in the country and sleep better with more nature sounds in the background). This was expected and we would happily stay there again. 

Ermanno also gave us a long list of his recommendations and the best was the private tour guide - Franchesca!! She was fabulous with tremendous knowledge of the history of Rome - answered so many questions and had some recommendations of restaurants of her own.  Can't wait to go back!

Thank you, Ermanno!!"

The apartment itself is nicely furnished and my family of five slept comfortably.  There are two bathrooms, so we were able to shower and prepare for our outings quickly.

Ermanno did a good job with communication, responding promptly and answering out questions.

We had an excellent experience and would definitely stay here again."

Our stay in Rome was much better than expected, kids loved it too and the location of the apartment contributed much to this. 
Ermanno is a wonderful host that gave us a lot of nice insider tips on where to eat and where to go.
Anytime again!
Thank you!!"
49240,155515296,2017-05-28,5439981,Ellie,"This place was in a great location to explore Rome. We didn't take public transit, we pretty much walked everywhere and saw so much. The place was cozy and secure. The only downside is the noise outside of the club across the street. "
49240,204894684,2017-10-20,34094298,Peter,"A very nice apartment that is ideally located only a couple short blocks from the Pantheon, grocery stores, and countless numbers of restaurants. Ermanno was a wonderful host who took the extra time to be sure we knew where to eat and how to get around town. The apartment is not huge and for the six of us (three adults and three children) it was a bit tight - but that is probably to be expected given the location. There was some noise at night from the nightclub across the street, but it was not horrible and did not keep us from sleeping.  The dishwasher was not working while we were there, but everything else was serviceable. All-in-all a great location that gives one the feeling of what it is like to live in a busy city like Rome."

We landed late in the night, and Ermanno helped arrange a taxi pickup from the airport which was much appreciated.  We also communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) during the stay and Ermanno was super responsive.  We were a family of four, with 2 preteens and the apartment was quite spacious.  The only thing to be aware of is the nightclub across the street which was a little noisy during weekends.  The weekdays were fine.  We highly recommend this apartment."
49240,330933546,2018-10-01,191789416,Chris,"Great place very central and walking distance to all main attractions. On the top floor (3or4) and no lift but not a big issue, just getting bags in and out on arrival and leaving. Well provided for with supermarket 2min away. Good beds. There is a nightclub near by that can be a bit noisy in early hours if you are a lite sleeper.
Recommend considering this place."
49240,583721095,2019-12-29,16596790,Nicole,"We were unable to stay at the apartment we had rented due to a heating issue , but Ermanno was extremely helpful in finding us an alternative. The place we did have was in a great location overall but not so much for us as we were further from the other parties we were traveling with. The apartment is suitable for a couple and 1 maybe 2 children but not a family of 5. Also the beds are very firm.
Overall it serviced our needs and Ermanno was a very helpful host."

Location is great, nice living area with a lot of shops and restaurants only a 5 minute walk from the Metro and Tram and a 10 minute walk from the Vatican. if you're lucky, Sita will give you the keys for the roof which has a stunning view over Rome. To find the right temperature for the shower is pretty difficult because of the boiler, but that's really about it if I really need to state any downside  - would definitely come again :)"

Die Wohnung, wir waren 3 Personen, perfekt. Sehr sauber und mit viel Herz eingerichtet. Alles NÃ¶tige war vorhanden. Auch den Balkon mit den Pflanzen haben wir sehr genossen.
Perfekt war auch, dass die Wohnung in einem Aussenquartier liegt aber nur ca. 15 Min. zu Fuss zum Vatikan.
In diesem Quartier kann man sich bestens vom ""Trubel"" im Zentrum erholen. Wir wÃ¼rden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen!

The light-flooded place, decorated in a very tasteful though unique way was only a short walk from the Vatican area and had everything we wished for - Sita even provided coffee, fruits, juice and bread to welcome us. The area is really nice and we found lots of great places to eat - thanks to Sita's recommendations! She also gave hints on how to get around and was very easy, friendly and reliable to communicate with.

Nous avons vraiment apprÃ©ciÃ© le fait que Sita Alessandra ait pris soin de nous Ã  notre arrivÃ©e: jus de fruit, brioches fruits, vin, etc.. L'accueil Ã©tait excellent. l'appartement est trÃ¨s pratique, agrÃ©able et confortable. Rien ne manque. La bibliothÃ¨que de CD roms est un peu ancienne, mais cela nous a permis de revisiter nos classiques. Pour commencer, le petit balconnet est parfait, Ã  deux, pour le petit dÃ©jeuner. Ensuite, si vous Ãªtes bons marcheurs, le cÅur de la ville sera Ã  vous en moins d'une heure Ã  pied. Si vous ne voulez pas vous fatiguer, le mÃ©tro ""Ottaviano"" est Ã  500 m. Personnellement, nous avons fait nos 15 km quotidiens et nos jambes ont adorÃ© Ã§a... En conclusion, c'est un lieu tranquille, pas loin du coeur de la citÃ© et que nous vous recommandons. Is & Stan."

50333,33265790,2015-05-26,3573921,Sumitha,"We had a lovely 3 night stay in Sita's apartment in Rome.
Sita is a very friendly and helpful person. She helped me with everything that I asked for, from booking taxis to guides...
The apartment is a a cosy place with all basic necessities. The kitchen is well stocked. Beds comfortable. The view from the balcony is amazing and the natural light falling in the house is beautiful. Due to some technical issues the wifi wasn't working and Sita was very kind and thoughtful to give us a refund for the same...
There are some nice eateries around and as Sita suggests Nicos was our favourite too. The metro is a short walk and you are in the city centre in 15 minutes. The Vatican is a 20 minute walk. 
Whenever I visit Rome again I will be back at Sita's apartment!

Sie hat uns schon vor der Reise mit vielen ausfÃ¼hrlichen und nÃ¼tzlichen Informationen versorgt, uns sehr herzlich empfangen und uns jederzeit ihre UnterstÃ¼tzung angeboten, obwohl ein Familienfest bevorstand. Die Wohnung haben wir wie beschrieben vorgefunden. Sie hat den Charme einer Altbauwohnung. Die Kuppel auf dem Foto ist tatsÃ¤chlich die des Petersdoms, weiter links reicht der Blick bis zu den Castelli. Alles ist fÃ¼r Sitas persÃ¶nliche Nutzung sehr individuell eingerichtet und zeugt von ihren vielfÃ¤ltigen Interessen. Allein die Bibliothek ist sehens- und lesenswert. Das Viertel ist sympathisch, mit kleinen Bars und Restaurants, der Vatikan liegt in fuÃlÃ¤ufiger Entfernung. Auch andere SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten haben wir teilweise zu FuÃ erkunden kÃ¶nnen (Metro-Streik!)"

Sita made us most welcome  with delicious fruit on a hot late Rome night even though she had just gotten married a few days before ! Sita's apartment is very charming  with  beautiful artwork and carefully chosen furniture. There is an incrdible library in  Italian and English. We particualry loved the kitchen . You must go to the food market on Andrea Doria that Sita recommends nearby, we bought cheeses and fruits and fresh pasat and bread and had a feast. The cafe opposite the market is a cheerful and inexpensive cafe for breakfast .  The views from the windows are glorious and there is a welcome strong breeze in the evening. We will stay here again in a heart beat if we  have the chance.

Sita even arranged a driver to pick us up from the airport who kept tabs on our flight number and still managed to pick us up even when we were redirected to a different airport.
We were left to our own privacy, but Sita was only a quick call away when required to recommend restaurants and offer advice.
this was our first time using airbnb and Sita and Bassam made our long weekend away an unforgettable one. Thank you : ) x"

We arrived very late on Thursday night/Friday morning and were welcomed by Sita's husband and a bottle of wine. The flat was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The lift is a bit small, but provides a much better alternative to walking up 8 flights of floors with a heavy bag. 

We would definitely recommend this place to other couples looking for a nice place to stay in Rome."

They have a list made out of recommended places to go/eat while in the city of which we tried and were delighted with. The apartment looks out over Roma and The beautiful Vatican city and is just 15 mins walk from the main hustle and bustle of the city centre....We walked most days because it was lovely to take in the non touristy neighborhoods along the way but the metro was just a short walk from the apartment on days when we fancied getting to places quicker....We liked to dip in and out of the centre and had beautiful dinners in the local neighbourhood one night followed by a livelier night in one of the many famous piazza's/campa's. The apartment was perfect for our stay and has all of the amenities to make your stay at Roma a very comfortable one. 
Thank you very much for everything Sita.

Great restaurants close by, safe neighborhood, convenient store at the top of the road is perfect, for picking up fresh meats and cheeses.   One last note Sita set up a private car to pick us up from the airport at a great rate. Which work perfect for us, as our flight was late and the driver monitored our new arrival time.  All in all I would highly recommend staying in the apartment and working with Sita."

She was very warm and kind and helpful the entire process and sent a great list of info and recommendations before we even arrived. The apartment is lovely and  calm. It was wonderful sitting out and having breakfast on the balcony. Sita also organized a car for us on our departure, as we were leaving at 4am, which we appreciated very much. We were able to do laundry and cook without issue. Thanks for everything Sita!"
50333,52827919,2015-11-02,5475517,David,"We were immediately made to feel at home by Bassam who went over all the necessary information. The neighborhood is quite nice, had a market, a laundry, several restaurants and  all the daily life requirements and was far enough away from the maddening crowds but convenient to a metro and buses. Of course the all-around views from this 8th floor corner apartment were divine, which, being in Rome, everything should be and the rooms are large and comfortable. Enjoyed being able to look at the many books in their collection. Also, the pre-arranged, requested taxi from and to the airport were a nice convenience."

The location f this apartment is excellent! Everything is very close. We almost walked to the every places. Sita is super super nice. She gave us some recommendations locations in Roma. It helped us enjoy the time in Roma better!
Thank you Sita! We had a great time in your apartment! Next time if we come to Roma, will definitely try to book it again!
Thank you for everything!
I can only recommend this apartment!"
50333,67201236,2016-03-27,17772541,Jan,"We stayed at Sitaâs beautiful place for about 9 days, visiting the museums and doing pencil sketches (weâre both artists). It is nice and comfortable, especially for people who enjoy an alternative lifestyle, but not only for those. The Musei Vaticani and other famous sites are in reach. The quarter is lively, but in a pleasant way. 
Sita and her husband Bassam are very charming people, not complicated at all, although their library proves their widespread intellectual interests (from Kant to T. S. Eliot, though some of them only in Italian translations ;-) They provided us with lots of valuable information on interesting places, restaurants, etc.
During our stay we unfortunately became victims of pickpockets on a crowded bus near Zanardelli Station, far away from Sitaâs flat. Sita and Bassam were extremely helpful in this unpleasant situation. We were truly grateful for their support. 
If we visit Rome again (we're sure, we will) we will gladly choose your apartment again, Sita and Bassam. 

Thanks a lot and best wishes.

Sita was very helpful, i left my coat in Venice and she volunteered to help me liaise with my Venice airbnb host to deliver my coat back. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, about 10min walk to Ottaviano station, 15min to vatican museum.l, and 15min to 24hr carrefour supermarket.

She helped me to settle in and was available for any questions- and even left us maps and suggestions for shops and restaurants etc close-by. The apartment was cosy, bright and had great views across the city including of St Peter's lit up at night. As a traditional flat in an old building it has plenty of character but all the modern comforts you would need: a lift, wifi, kettle, washing machine etc.

Do not hesitate to try the local pizza restaurant across the street. The local cafe is also very nice, and the people who work there are very friendly. Sita, the host, is great, very helpful and responsive."
50333,158065186,2017-06-05,6634180,Lena,"First of all, the flat was nice with good views although many unfinished parts such as wires extruding the walls and a bath incongruously at the end of the bedroom. Location wise the flat is 25 minutes to town walking or transport and 10 minute walk to the Vatican. 

The experience with the host was negative. First time this has happened after many airbnb stays. She falsely accused us of having someone stay over and tried to charge us extra. She sent lengthy accusative messages. And even before we arrived she was impatient for email responses to photos she sent that we hadn't asked for. Unnecessary stress on what was a fine trip. "
50333,161275734,2017-06-17,66531450,Marloes,The apartment is stunning and Sits id  a very kind person. Thank you for taking care of us.
50333,163326953,2017-06-24,42537710,Lydie,"We stayed at Sitaâs place for an entire week. Sita was very communicative and provided detailed information and instructions about her place before we arrived, then gave us a warm welcome, and remained very attentive during our stay. We did not see her again after the initial welcome, but she checked in via email mid-way to ensure we were enjoying our stay, or in case we needed anything. Her flat seemed newly renovated, was very clean (spotless), and had wonderful natural light throughout.  Prior to arriving, I was a tad apprehensive about not staying right in the middle of the city center, but having been to Rome twice before and knowing my way around somewhat, I felt we could make it work, and that walking anywhere from Sitaâs place would not be a major task. That was easier to do at night when the temperatures cool down. Therefore, we quickly decided to take the metro around which was super accessible at just six minutes away and easy to find. Once you get to the metro station, you can buy tickets at the automatic machines (cash only), each ride is just 1,50 euro and you can use the ticket at the metro, the tram, or the bus system for 100 minutes after the initial validation. The station nearby, Ottaviano, is close to the Vatican and it also stops at most of the major landmarks (Piazza del Popolo, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Termini Station).  Since we had plans to do several day trips outside of Rome, we knew we were not going to spend all of our time in Rome, but it was nice to come back to the same place each night and not have to move around hotels. Once we discovered how easy it was to take the metro around town, we were extra happy to have stayed at Sitaâs place and also discovered that her neighborhood was a jewel for great restaurants as well (check out Cacio e Pepe).  We also used Uber a couple of times without a problem. Overall, a wonderful visit and stay. Grazie mille, Sita!"
50333,169658445,2017-07-13,46147623,Hui,"We have been stay at Rome for four days,in these days stay in Sita' s house,we have the best location,great view,and very nice neighborhood,after all it's surely all by Sita's   work. So I must introduce this great apartment to you"

Go there and find out.... it is just super !!!      
if we ever come back to Rome, this will be the place to be. 
Sita is a great host..you get all the informations you need, you get all the answers to any question you have. And on the other hand, she gives you all the privacy you need.
five stars .....!!"
50333,270717010,2018-05-30,54511059,Katarzyna,"We spent in Rome 5 wonderful daysâ¦ unfortunately just 5 days :( Sitaâs apartment was a perfect addition to our great stay. Spacious, very clean and well equipped, but most of all beautiful and originally decorated. We felt like home! Preparing delicious Italian pasta and eating it on the balcony will be one of our best memories from Rome. 
Neighborhood is not touristy, so you can feel like a local a little bit. There are many atmospheric, small shops, bakeries and restaurants with a great food nearby (Sita, thank you for your guide!). Itâs worth to wander around a bit and forget about lines to the Colosseum."
50333,272869248,2018-06-04,27862153,Karl,"
The only thing wrong with this place is that we donât live here.
Perfect location ...  a short walk from the Vatican and historic center.
Itâs a beautiful apartment with everything you need.
Lovely hosts.
Great neighborhood .
Metro 8 min walk .
Great view .
We can not recommend this place enough.
I hope itâs vacant on our next visit to Rome."
50333,276254698,2018-06-13,14114844,Neera,"Sita is an amazing host ! She was very fast in responding. She greeted us in person - with fruits, biscotti and baked goods. The apartment had everything we need. It is at a good location. Sita and her husband have complied resources - restaurants and gelaterrias in the neighbourhood that was found very useful. Well-sticked kitchen and it was good to cook a few meals at home."

50333,320093857,2018-09-08,208476880,Marta,"Sitaâs place is lovely! It is well furnished and equipped with all sorts of things that made our stay comfortable. Not to mention attention to detail and artistic touch with which the flat is decorated. Being on the 8th floor with an elevator was a plus - far away from street noise, pleasant draft when opening the windows and a great view of the neighborhood and St. Peterâs Basilica. The location of the flat is a compromise between being a bus ride from the historic sites and only a short walk to good, not so touristy restaurants. The only thing for improvement is the cleanliness of the kitchen that could use a general cleaning. We spent little time cooking, so that was not too much of a problem. The rest of the flat is impeccable.
And when it comes to Sita and her husband - great, outgoing and helpful people who care about their guests. They dedicated enough time to explain everything and were at our disposal afterwards without being intrusive in any way. Handover of the keys and everything around administration went easy and with great deal of humor. Many many thanks!!! So, definitely a recommendation from me and my freind!"

In the kitchen you can find everything you need if you want to cook smth. There is a small cute balcony where you can sit in the evening with a glass of wine. Location is perfect if you don't like noise and crowds of people, Vatican and Castel Sant'Angelo are very close to Sita's apartment. Only 7-10 minutes walk to metro station, so you can get to all points of interest in 20 min. Sita and her friend Benedetta were super friendly and hospitable. Highly recommend!"
50333,458582431,2019-05-26,26991761,Robin,"This was our first trip to Rome and Sita's place was perfect for us. Not only was the apartment lovely, well situated, and comfortable, but Sita was an excellent hostess. She responded quickly to all of our questions, helped book transportation to and from the airport, and provided helpful tips for local cafes, restaurants and shops. We had a few days planned around Vatican City and Sita's apartment was an easy walk to get there. We could see the dome of St. Peter's lit up from our balcony at night and on our final evening, there was a fireworks display that we watched with delight from the rooftop of the building. So nice!"
50333,461684156,2019-06-01,3731854,Ramona,"Beautifully stylish apartment with a great view and all the amenities. Easy access to buses and the metro, or a long walk through a lovely city will get you most places you want to go."

50333,468769558,2019-06-13,44058266,Stathis,"The apartment is very nice and it is as seen in the photographs.
It has nice views to Rome and it's very quiet and spacious. 
Sita Alessandra was very helpful and she responded to my questions about the bath. I messed up one set of the keys of the apartment with my wife's but I hope to sort it out soon. 
In the bedroom there is a fun that helps to keep the temperature low but keep in mind that there is no air-condition.
It's a highly recommended apartment and I hope I will be back if it's free for my next trip to Rome."
50333,473309049,2019-06-21,18125955,Elizabeth,"Sita's place was perfect for our recent week long trip to Rome - the communication in the lead up to our stay was efficient and clear and Sita was always happy to assist wherever possible, booking our travel to and from the airport with reliable drivers. 
The apartment was spacious and clean with a beautiful view of St Peters Basilica from the balcony.
Location is good, in a buzzing neighbourhood with nice local restaurant options; on our final night we enjoyed the best meal we had in Rome from Bancina 63 just opposite the apartment, highly recommend if you're after somewhere with no tourists! 
The Vatican is only 10 minutes away, however all of the other iconic tourist attractions are within an hours walk from the apartment, which with plenty of Aperol stops was perfect for us. We didn't use the metro once!
Overal, a lovely trip and we can't wait to return.
Grazie Sita!"

I would give the place a five-star-rating. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need (we ended up cooking at home a lot, there is a carrefour supermarket, which is located in 15 min walking distance (24 hrs open) , the communication with Sita and her group of friends was outstanding, Rita has even set up a (Hidden by Airbnb) group for the duration of our stay - and last not least: the view is stunning!

thank you so much for all you did for us to have a pleasant stay. 
Your flat is beautiful with nice things to look at inside and outside (the dome). 
We highly recommend your place. 
Metro Station Vaticano can be reached in a few minutes. 
Busses in Rome run very often but they are allway full of people.
When we plan our next visit to Rome we will try to come back to your place.
Have a nice summer (in Rome or where ever to are)

It has a great view, a really unique vibe, perfect cleanliness, working appliances for the stay. The bed is very comfy and the little touches, here and there really make the house your home for the entire stay. 
The guestbook she has is a very well prepared guide, so you can immediately join the flow of this wonderful city.

Although we never met in person the communication before and during our stay was easy and friendly and the way the apartment is decorated is just unique! we felt instantly welcomed. Ottaviano as a neighbourhood is very beautiful with good restaurants apart from the tourist streams. and the view from the apartment is just wonderful. highly recommended!
50333,611819312,2020-02-28,8753291,Ingeborg Margrete,"Sita Alessandra's place was a beautiful safe haven during our stay in Rome. The apartment is bright, cosy and feels like home. The kitchen has great amenities where we could make lovely Italian espresso each morning. The balcony and roof terrace gives a wonderful view over Rome, and the location is close to the Vatican and other parts of the city of you enjoy a short walk. I would definitely stay there again if I'm going to Rome again."

50333,655901443,2020-08-24,2796976,Francesca,We had a wonderful stay at Sitaâs apartment. The apartment is thoughtfully designed with a tremendous view overlooking the Vatican. The district of Prati feels local and there are some nice restaurants and bars within a 15 min walk of the apartment. Would definitely stay there again

We also really enjoyed the outdoor fruit and vegetable market around the corner.  I'd definitely stay here if I go to Rome again."
50385,182859,2011-02-15,288734,Tom,As advertised Laura's place is small but beautiful and good value. The bonus was that the local neighbourhood was pretty cool and it's an easy tram or bus into the centre. Recommend to anyone wanting a simple low cost place to stay in a cool part of Rome. Thanks Laura!
50385,185827,2011-02-21,371819,Patricia,"Laura was a great host. We unfortunately didn't get to meet her because she was out of town when we were in Rome, but she was very helpful and gave us all the information we needed. The space was very small but would be comfortable for a couple or two close friends. The only downside to the studio is that it is somewhat in the periphery of the city (though the city centre was accessible by public transport) and is not the quintessential Rome you would think of. "
50385,222074,2011-04-10,447543,Frank,"Laura's studio apartment was pretty awesome. It features good use of space, including a loft-type bed. Some people may consider it small, but I've stayed in hotel rooms which were much smaller. The apartment is about a 15-20 minute ride from Termini station on the #105 line (just tell the driver ""Fermata Santa Elena, per favore,"" and he'll let you off at the right stop). The neighborhood is very nice and has a farmer's market every morning where you can stock up on fruits and veggies. And for you vinyl junkies, Radiation Records is just a few blocks away. I didn't get to meet Laura in person, but she was very responsive to emails (Helpful hint: make sure the water heater's thermostat is turned on before taking a shower!). And she has a great selection of Diabolik and Dylan Dog (soon to be a major motion picture!) comics in the apartment. The only negative I can think of is that the washing machine was out of order during my stay, but there are a couple of laundromats nearby. Overall, I had a great experience and would recommend the studio to anyone wanting a cool place to stay in Rome."
50385,233997,2011-04-21,428232,Lena,"Thank you very much for this great opportunity to stay in your appartment, Laura. It is really unique - totally cosy - and we enjoyed to live there for serveral days. 

The neighborhood is also very great - it's like NeukÃ¶lln in Roma and we really enjoyed to spent time there. 

All the best for you Laura -
Hugs,

50385,240984,2011-04-26,429501,Martina,"Everything went smoothly and Laura was an excellent host. The flat was tiny but it was enough for two. We really liked the area with the nice outside bars and cafes, and especially due to the fact that it was not filled with tourists. Would recommend this place to anyone traveling as a couple or alone.  "
50385,245374,2011-04-30,465848,Jhanne,"A great place to crash after a long day in Rome! As described by Laura, the apartment is small but special, and it has its charm. Laura has been very helpful and assisted us with our requests during our entire stay. I would highly recommend Laura as a host."
50385,249627,2011-05-03,113828,Celina,"We had a great time at Laura's apartment. Great little area. It was lovely to get away from the hoardes of tourists who choke the central part of Rome, but still have a real Roman feel about the place. Laura was really helpful, sticking around although we were late, and the apartment was clean and well-equiped, everything we needed. 

The size really wasn't a problem, particularly coming from London and having stayed in many a small apartment during our time. There was plenty of space for a couple (so long as you don't mind no door on the toilet). "
50385,259904,2011-05-11,486125,Rob,"Laura and her partner Roberto made my stay comfortable and authentic.  I could not recommend their place enough.

50385,328281,2011-06-22,418806,Dave,"From the moment I stumbled upon this place on airbnb I had my mind set on it. It would be the ideal place to take my girlfriend as she would (as much as I would) totally love the creative interior, the different salts and oils in the kitchen, the funky bathroom, soaps etc. Together with the fact that the neighborhood was mentioned as one of the most lively and creative ones of Rome, it seemed the ideal place to stay for our one year anniversary.  I was shocked to find out that maybe someone else had the place booked. After some very swift and friendly communication with Laura we managed to get it ! Arrangements were made via email and SMS and we arrived with two heads waiting for us. The apartment felt like home immediately and after some shopping around the corner (yes.... the neighborhood is indeed amazing) we enjoyed the roof terrace for food and wine. 
We had a wonderful 3 night stay and every time we came back to our new 'home away from home' and our 'hood' it felt super.
We've enjoyed staying here soo much as this place provided us with all we needed and more plus the best vibe possible. (did I mention the fact that I was able to read the few Calvin & Hobbes that I was missing in my collection??)

Finally I want to ask you to please give your place the bit of extra love it needs to keep it for us all to visit in the next 10,20, 50 years to come !

50385,361851,2011-07-09,578032,Carol,"This is a good apartment if you don't mind using the city busses and are a savvy about Rome. It's small, but has a well equipped kitchen and a great wireless connection. It's in a trendy part of the city that is away from the main tourist attractions. Laura was very helpful and gave great directions about how to get around."
50385,372356,2011-07-14,535990,Alan,"A cosy little place! Despite our late flight and extra delay, we were able to collect the keys near Termini Station before heading directly to the apartment. The apartment has everything one would need, except the washing machine wasn't working at the time- which was particularly unfortunate for us as we carrying a bunch of clothes that could do with a good clean! Buses run frequently to the area, even throughout the night and there existed a small handful of tourists also residing nearby at a local hotel. The area in itself has a unique charm, far different to the centre of Rome, however during the night things can get loud if stray drunkards decide to pitch a hangout spot near by... Besides this slight drawback, it was a thoroughly good stay and would recommend to all travellers on a budget!"
50385,383179,2011-07-19,724242,Gianluca,"Awesome!

50385,387262,2011-07-21,489295,Ashley,"This little studio was great. It was very convenient to have a small kitchen right in the room. Internet was easy. Bed was comfortable and Laura is great. The only downside to this eccentric little apartment is that it is not walkable to downtown Rome, but the metro is not a far walk if you are the walking type and once you are there it's easy to access the rest of the city. Laura is very accommodating and is great with giving directions. The farmers market in the morning is fantastic and the area is filled with younger folks and fun restaurants that come out later in the evening. "
50385,395176,2011-07-25,686408,Lei,"Laura's place is very charming! It's in a quaint neighborhood, with farmer's market in the morning and restaurants at night within 5 minutes walking distance. It's definitely a local experience in Rome! The place is not very big, but definitely livable for two and even three people. The kitchen is very well stocked, and she has a shelf of English books to read!"
50385,408817,2011-07-31,602931,Vivek,"I'm split on this place- to sum up, I think it's a good place for someone (or a couple) who are:
a) traveling lite/don't plan to be at home a lot
b) like to stay out late-ish (in which case the notes on noise below won't really be relevant)
c) want to check out a cool/up and coming area that doesn't attract many tourists
d) have been to Rome before/aren't interested in only ""tourist"" destinations/have a few days in Rome.

Longer reasons below:

5 stars: price for a place in rome - this place is as inexpensive as you'll get, especially on short notice, and you don't need to deal with other boarders (hostel) or a shared bathroom (b&b).

4 stars: close to a cool street (Pigneto) which seems like a up-and-coming area with good restaurants, shops, and ""real romans"" (as opposed to the tourist throngs.)
-full kitchen
-clean

3 stars: the following are all things that are listed in Laura's (the host's) own description of the place, so it's not like they were surprises. but they're worth knowing:
-Noisy. One night wasn't too bad, but Friday night was really loud. It's a basement apartment with the window facing a side-street, but that street gets a surprising bit of traffic and there was not infrequently someone idling a scooter or saying a long goodbye right above our heads :) Pigneto, the street around the corner, has good restaurants and bars that draw large crowds, and this is the downside of that.
-25 minutes from city center, with a bus change for many locations - not the end of the world, but if it's your first time to Rome or you're only around for a short time, you'll need to take this into account. Trastavere is another 10 minutes or so. You can walk but it's sort of a long/ unattractive walk. 
-Random guys hanging out on street -- this one's a bit weird.  It wasn't a big deal- the street seemed pretty safe -- but there was always (morning-late night) a group of guys hanging out in front of the building across the way. It seemed like they were doing business out of there/watching the street, so it was a bit sketchy. But other than that it seems like safe area.  EDITED: After chatting with Laura after this review - she took the time to read this and let me know that the guys hanging out on the street are just living in the house across the street and have been there for a while/are friendly.  
-Small - Loft bed with window to street at your head. Bathroom is very small. No place to sit and relax (but you're in Rome and around the corner from fantastic cafes, restaurants etc., so why sit at home?)

50385,418103,2011-08-03,847367,Veronica,"This place was pretty much exactly what I was expecting - it is very tiny, but definitely special!  Laura did a great job of turning a small space into a charming and comfortable environment.  

I would recommend familiarizing yourself with the bus routes from the apartment, as it's a fair distance from the Vatican and the Colosseum.  However, as a result of this distance, it's also a little bit ""off the beaten path"", and away from the tourists.  There is a market very close-by (we bought a lot of fresh fruit for our breakfasts), and one of the nearby restaurant that Laura suggests in her house-book was a much more genuine restaurant experience than what we'd gotten so far along ""the tourist strip"".  (This restaurant also had delicious house wine for 3 Euros/bottle!)

We stayed at many apartments on our trip through Italy, but this one was my favourite.

50385,445491,2011-08-15,542177,Ãmilie,We spend a very good week in Laura's studio. Rome was great !
50385,501704,2011-09-05,676814,Kristina,"The apartment was pretty small, but just enough space for two! we had everything we needed, there are quaint restaurants in the area, and the neighborhood is close enough to central Rome, but just far enough away to feel like you're out of the tourist scene and apart of a quaint neighborhood!
Great place, highly recommend staying here!"
50385,520451,2011-09-11,862766,Randy,"The apartment is small  but worked great for us. Having the stove top, microwave and refrigerator was a bonus as we do not eat out much to save money. Location is good since the bus stops are within a few blocks and can reach the termini within 20 minutes. Having the farmers market around the corner and a couple of grocery stores nearby was nice. The farmers market turned into restaurants in the evening so you do not need to take the bus or taxi to eat. Laura was extremely helpful with all of the instructions on how to find the apartment and getting around rome. She told us what buses and trains to take to get to different parts of the city. The only downside to the apartment is that is it located on a very busy street and the windows are at street level. It was often quite loud at night with traffic and pedestrian noise. The unit does not have air conditioning. So, we were unable to close the windows in hopes of lessening the noise due to the September heat. Other than that, the apartment is a great place to stay!"
50385,530471,2011-09-14,421224,Sayge,Laura was awesome! We arrived late due to bus schedules but she had waited for us.  She showed us the apartment recommended places to go and left a delicious bottle of wine set up for us.  There was an amazing pizza place just down the street and easy access to the buses and train.  Thank you for a beautiful experience!
50385,660825,2011-10-24,548452,Maxime,"Our stay at Laura's studio was great, it's really nice small indeed but there's enough place for all we needed. 
The neighborhood is great, popular, living with a lot of bar, a farmer's market and some cool place to eat, almost no tourist in this neighborhood, which is rare in that city, and make things feeling more authentic and nice.
A great place to go to !"
50385,801717,2011-12-23,1441804,Daniela,"Me and my friend stayed in Laura's place for 10 days last December and it really was lovely. Laura organized everything, even we didn't even meet her, and got the flat keys and everything else we needed. Her description of the flat didn't hide anything. It is tiny but enough for a short trip and really lovely. Pigneto is especially a great place to stay, you've got a lot of friendly people, cafes and shops around, there are many bus and tram stations around, so you would always find your way back and you'll be in the city center in about 15 minutes. We liked it so much, that we recommended her place to friends of us ;) so, of course i would recommend it to anyone else... have fun there"
50385,1057894,2012-03-29,997726,Josephine,"LauraÂ´s description describes her place to a T so if you read her description, there arenÂ´t any secrets waiting for you. It is very tiny but perfect for two, especially if youÂ´re going to be out most of the time. It is located near many tram stops (we commonly used the Bus 105 and 81 as well as the Tram 5 or 14 to reach the city center). I really loved the farmerÂ´s market that opened up on Via di Pigneto. I bought 250grams of fresh mozzarella from a stall and it was hands-down the best mozzarella I have ever eaten. The area is very lively and busy, so please be aware that at night it can be noisy. One of the places I can highly recommend is an ice cream shop located a few streets from her place that serves rose, violet, and wine flavored gelato. It was fabulous. 
Laura was a terrific host, from the beginning to the end. She even walked a bit to find us on our first night since we got a bit lost coming from the bus stop. I definitely recommend staying with her. "
50385,1109667,2012-04-11,1724129,Kenneth,"Laura has a very nice little studio, in a very nice neighborhood and Laura is the perfect host! It is small, but for us, it was more than enough space. It might be a bit noisy at times. The best thing with staying in Laura's place was the location. It is centrally located in Pigneto, an area full of nice restaurants and bars and away from most tourists... If you don't mind a 15 minutes bus ride from the center of Rome, I would definitively recommend this studio.

"
50385,1254058,2012-05-09,2142741,Marlon,"Very nice appartment which was exactly as explained. We were nicely welcomed even if we arrived (too) late in the night! The appartment is indeed not very big but big enough to sleep in there for a travel in Rome. Nice attentions of Laura too who was very helpful when we were planning our arrival / departure.
I warmly recommand this appartment."
50385,1606629,2012-07-01,1419402,Eva,"Staying in Laura's studio was great! You can tell she cares a lot about her studio, and about her guests. I loved the neighborhood: it's a artsy, young, and multicultural (so might not be for everyone), but it's not the typical Rome you'd expect.  Laura couldn't check us in herself the day we arrived, but everything went smoothly and we met up another day for coffee. The place is quite small but the space is wisely used, and there is everything one could need (great internet connection, fully equipped kitchen!) I called Laura a few times for help with taxi booking etc and she was always there for us. Gracie!"
50385,1682007,2012-07-11,983631,Maya,"Laura is a very friendly and considerate hostess. It is a hostess, whom you can always trust and who will take care and solve any problem you might have. When we came, she gave us all the detailed directions, how would we get to the studio, so we didn't have to worry about that at all! When we arrived there was a bottle of wine waiting for us . Nice detail :-)"
50385,1947451,2012-08-11,1445934,Katie,"Laura's apartment is everything you could need accommodation-wise. The kitchen is extensive and the bed is incredibly comfy. We stayed a week in this apartment and couldn't want for anything! Laura herself is incredibly friendly and helpful - she even sent us an email after waiting for us to settle in, telling us great spots in the neighbourhood to check out. I would recommend this apartment whole-heartedly :)"
50385,2462715,2012-10-01,2764029,Clara,"Laura est une hÃ´te extrÃªmement attentive. Elle est prÃ©sente et rÃ©pond aux besoins de tous. J'ai adorÃ© passer dix jours dans son petit studio trÃ¨s bien amÃ©nagÃ© et situÃ© dans un quartier agrÃ©able mais un peu loin du centre historique de Rome. NÃ©anmoins, il y a des bus qui passent tout prÃ¨s et rapidement on se retrouve oÃ¹ l'on veut. Le soir la Vial del Pigneto est animÃ© et prendre un ""apertitivo"" avec de la charcuterie et un peu de fromage devient vite une habitude! Merci beaucoup Laura! Clara"
50385,2620081,2012-10-15,3682737,Anne-Laure,"Really nice place, not far from the city center with the bus!
Laura has been really helpfull with a lot of explanations and good plans! 
DO not hesitate to visit Rome staying at her place ;-)"
50385,3263931,2013-01-04,3209358,Victoria,"Laura was a very helpful and nice host. She supported us greatly during our stay in Rome, even though we hadn't a possibility to stay in her apartment. Nevertheless, Laura found a good alternative for us and we are very thankful for her help and time.  "
50385,3862826,2013-03-22,4742507,Mariana,"Laura's place is amazing! The house is small but very cozy and comfortable. But the best part is the location. At day, via del pigneto has the markets (food, clothes, toys) and at night the street fills with nice bars and restaurants. The area don't has almost any tourist and you can find everything you need near by!"
50385,3951890,2013-03-30,5385732,Antoine,"We stayed a couple of day in Rome and this flat was pretty good for us. Laura was really helpfull with us and answered to a lot of questions. There was just few problems but it was not a big deal 
:
Electricity (if you plug 2 or 3 things in the same time, the electric system is down). 

It's was not really sunny because it's below street level.

Otherwise we had a nice stay in this flat."
50385,4021814,2013-04-03,5159196,Chiara,Il pigneto Ã¨ un quartiere multietnico molto vivo e brioso; in 15/20 mm di autobus sei alla stazione termini da dove si snodano tutti i mezzi per ogni destinazione quindi ben servito. La casa si trova in una via tranquilla e Laura Ã¨ stata molto attenta alle nostre esigenze. 
50385,4233298,2013-04-21,1469829,Charlotte,"Laura is a great host. We did not meet her, but we've exchanged many messages!

The flat is situated in a great non-touristic area. Pigneto is really nice, with many bars, enotecas, and a charming market every morning.
We've moved by feet, most of time. Of course, it is quite long, but not  impossible, and this is a good way to discover many 'stuffs'!

The flat corresponds exactly to the airbnb announce. 
It is perfect to discover Roma!"
50385,4283299,2013-04-24,5416314,Gladys,The stay was comfortable and laura was very  thoughtful in getting settled in
50385,4503949,2013-05-09,5285408,ClÃ©ment,"We stayed for 4 days in Laura's appartment, and it was a great stay. The weather wasn't on our side, but Laura's appartment is really great, cosy and nice. The bed and all the other wooden parts create a really warm atmosphere in the appartment. 

The neighborhood, Il Pigneto, is a bit far from the main monuments which is both great and bad : it takes sometimes long to get to the center, but you don't see any tourists around (and that's surprising provided how many tourists there is in Rome). Plus, the neighborhood is really lively, with nice (and locals) bars & trattorias. "
50385,4544843,2013-05-12,4576777,Thomas,"The appartment corresponds to the description on the site. It's easily to reach with the bus from termini (Bus 105).
it's typical neighborhood and very sympatic, you can find shops and market.
The appartment is ok for a stay around 3 days."
50385,5158382,2013-06-16,4833619,Cosette,"We arrived at the airport and Laura had sent a taxi to pick us up. We went to her apartment and the pictures are on point. It is very small but cosy. We absolutely loved the area, the night life was amazing. And right around the corner are amazing restaurants! The area is not busy during the day but they do have a farmers market everyday. At night it is a young crowd with people everywhere. My boyfriend and I are 21 yrs old so this was perfect  for us. The only negative was that it was loud outside up until 2 or 3 in the morning, we did sleep with te windows open though so I'm sure normally its not that loud. All in all a great place! Laura was so nice and helpful we had an amazing time!!"
50385,5633443,2013-07-09,4756522,Alexandra,"My partner and I stayed in Laura's apartment in Pigneto for 8 amazing days. Even though it is small the apartment is perfect and has everything you need - a comfortable bed, stocked kitchen, private bathroom, kitchen table and space for your stuff. It is close to a lot of really great bars and food places, and because it is just out of the centre everything was very affordable (especially the wine!). The supermarket Tuodi is within walking distance to get your groceries, which is super convenient. Also the apartment is close to the buses so transport wasn't a problem. Pigneto itself is an awesome area, really lively, cool and artsy, but not pretentious. Although we wanted to see the touristy things we also wanted to experience a more authentic side of Rome, and this was the perfect place for that. To top it off, Laura was lovely, easy to communicate with and very helpful, offering suggestions of places to go and things to see in the area. If you're planning a trip to Rome
and you're looking for something special, I absolutely recommend Laura's apartment."
50385,5765058,2013-07-15,1231363,Maxim,"Thank you, Laura) It's been such a pleasure to stay in your apartment. It was so beautiful and perfect size for 2 people. We had everything we need- all suppliers for cooking (there was an absolutely adorable tiny local market right outside the corner and we cooked every morning). I definetly recommend this place if you want to observe local life and get rid from the touristic crowd. Hope to come back one day)"
50385,6556239,2013-08-17,4180125,Florian,"We spent a very peaceful week in Laura's apartment. 
At first sight, the place is small but with a lot of charm. 
Big enough for one week:
The bed is comfortable, small bathroom with towels high wifi device, kitchenette, and even a welcoming wine bottle.
Pigneto district is lively with many bars and restaurants (try ""Primo"", ""Fanfulla"", ""Mimi & Cocozza"") on the pedonale; supermarkets, night shops, pharmacy are around.
To join Roma centre, Bus 105 goes to Termini very quickly, Bus 108 and 81 towards Venezia Place. Good news: A metro station  should be around Pigneto in 2014.
Last words on Laura: Even if she wasn't here, she was very reactive to keep in touch and bring some infos."
50385,6766504,2013-08-24,5737271,Samantha,"We had a great time exploring Rome and staying at Laura's little place.  It had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  We got to cook a lot and the bed is very comfy!  Definitely out of the heart of the city though, so if you don't have a car it might be difficult ( we had bikes).  Rome is a beautiful city, amazing things to see around every corner! "
50385,7598680,2013-09-26,5114438,Jost,"Everything was well organised. Our late arrival wasn't a problem. Though Laura wasn't there her neighbour let us in. The apartments surrounding were pretty lively and it was a great way of spending the evenings away from the touristy city centre. The apartment itself, is tiny as described and bigger people than us would probably feel uncomfortable especially on the toilet.
Thanks Laura"
50385,7997893,2013-10-12,5303915,Christoph,"Cute & small flat in Pigneto, ideal for the two of us. Not far from the next bus stop. Laura organized everything very good, her neighbor was there, so everything was fine. Recommandations!"
50385,10702427,2014-03-03,12485054,Marie,Very Nice place!!we've loved!!
50385,11328466,2014-03-30,12575694,Cristina,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Laura's apartment for 22 days and we had a wonderful time. The place just felt like home rightaway. We stayed a long time and the fact that the place was so small  was a huge help in keeping the place tidy and nice, like you would treat your home. 

We had everything we needed really close, supermarkets, drug stores, restaurants, and a metro station at a walking distance. We cooked a lot (mainly a LOT of pasta) and Laura's kitchen was well equipped with everything we could need. 

The wifi connection was a little bit unstable but Laura was so nice and offered to bring us a router but we didn't minded that.

The place is very noisy with people coming and going at night and early in the morning, but we didn't really minded that either.

Overall, the place has a great vibe, feels cozy and homy, and we loved the tiny space's efficency. It is truly a tiny but very special apartment. 

We didn't get to meet Laura but she always answered our emails and arranged a cab to drop us at the airport. 

We also loved that Laura was a very attentive host but she wouldn't impose, barge in or drop by unannounced. 

We would love to go back!

50385,15185685,2014-07-04,5339140,Kate,"This is a great little place. Laura was very easy to communicate with (even when I was not, due to travel cell phone problems) It was exactly as advertised and I had a terrific stay!"
50385,24657945,2015-01-01,9755837,Larissa,"Hallo! I've had a lovely stay in Laura's apartment. Laura was always attentive, she answered all of my emails and sms promptly. The location instructions are very accurate, and I could find the place easily. The apartment is very comfortable and cozy. It's equipped with kitchen appliances, blankets and bath towels. Unfortunately, there are only 30L of hot water, that's a quick shower for me! And it takes around 1 hour until the tank is full again. The heating is electric and it doesn't really warm up the whole apartment, I had to move it around depending of what I was doing. But those downsides did not make my stay less enjoyable. There are a lot of books there in many languages, and the apartment is beautfully decorated, that gives a cool homely feeling.  The neighborhood is really live, there are Bars und Pizzerias, Bakeries, Supermarkets and Grocery Shops, there's also a street market for veggies and fruits and fish. The apartment is well located in the city, there are many Buses and Tram lines in its direction. And it's also possible to walk to Termini, it's not far. I'd say I've had a good time by Laura's apartment and I'd stay there again, and I'd also recommend it. Thank you, Laura!"
50385,29310774,2015-04-06,21205874,Michelle.,"The flat is as described, quite small but quaint and clean. The location is conveniently accessible by transit, with all needed amenities nearby. Laura was a very responsive host and we had a comfortable stay due to this. Also the food tips and other information Laura provided really enhanced our time in Rome!"
50385,31828207,2015-05-10,25351065,Sylvia,"Super sÃ©jour! L'appartement correspond parfaitement Ã  la description et le quartier est trÃ¨ss vivant (surtout le week end). Un agrÃ©able sÃ©jour, on recommande!!! Merci Laura!
"
50385,32525930,2015-05-19,10325637,GrÃ©goire & Lauranne,"Stayin at Lauraâs place was pretty cool ! Easy to communicate with, she guided us in Rome each time we needed her help. Furthermore, Pigneto is such a vibrant neighbourhood which Laura knows pretty well. Sheâll tell you about some great spots. Thanks again Laura !"
50385,32919081,2015-05-23,18970311,Niklas,"Laura was a great host and we enjoyed the stay in her apartment a lot. The kitchen is very well equipped and very clean. The neighborhood is very international, young and interesting. "
50385,48575618,2015-09-27,5727195,Alex & Dave,"The toilet didn't flush for our entire stay, there was barley any toilet paper, the light in the bathroom was blown. There was no door on the bathroom, and there is direct street noise through the night. The neighbourhood is really nice. It wasn't the right place for us, and Laura was hard to get hold of, but if you don't mind noise etc the location is good."
50385,50019020,2015-10-08,43712710,Eva,The apartment is small but nice and clean and very good located (ca 15 minutes with a bus to the city centre). Laura is a good host. I highly recommend!
50385,50810093,2015-10-14,4048167,Audrey,"We couldn't meet Laura but her apartment was perfect: we could find everything we needed. It was our first time in Rome and, even though Pigneto is a neighborhood a bit outside the center, it was easy to travel with public transportation and we could walk everywhere we wanted. Also, the neighborhood itself is nice and has very nice little street full of bars and  restaurants that were cheaper than in the rest of Rome. We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to come back. Thanks!"
50385,53203917,2015-11-06,45234875,Jonathan,Staying at this tiny cozy place was great. Laura helped us with everything we needed and replied to all our questions in the moment. Thank you!
50385,53634478,2015-11-10,10779859,Lucie,"Nous avons passÃ© un excellent sÃ©jour dans ce logement. L'hÃ©bergement est petit en superficie, mais trÃ¨s cosy et parfait pour deux personnes. SituÃ© Ã  20min environ du cÅur de Rome et bien desservi par les transports en commun (bus, tram et mÃ©tro), les lieux touristiques y sont facilement accessibles. En amont de notre voyage ou pendant, Laura a toujours Ã©tÃ© disponible et arrangeante avec nous. Les petits bÃ©mol de l'appartement c'est qu'il est mal isolÃ©, mais la rue reste peu bruyante. Le plus ""gÃªnant"" reste la salle de bain avec les toilettes et la salle de vue uniquement sÃ©parÃ© par un rideau. MalgrÃ© tout je recommande ce logement. "
50385,54164781,2015-11-16,43744704,Daniel,"I really enjoyed my stay in this flat, it had everything I needed and was in an ideal location to get into the centre of the city! The flat was very clean and had a really unique vibe. I would want to stay here again if I were to come back to Rome."
50385,55211591,2015-11-29,45757378,Paula,"El apartamento es un fiel reflejo de las fotos que Laura dejÃ³ en la pÃ¡gina. El tamaÃ±o reducido no es un inconveniente, incluso lo hace mÃ¡s funcional. Es ideal para dos personas. La cama, a pesar de estar elevada, es muy cÃ³moda. AdemÃ¡s, el apartamento estÃ¡ perfectamente equipado con todos los Ãºtiles de cocina necesarios (no fue nuestro caso, ya que en el mismo barrio, encontramos una oferta amplia de establecimientos y supermercados para pasar los 3 dÃ­as de nuestro viaje). 

Gracias a las explicaciones de Laura, pudimos encontrarlo a la primera. La calle donde se encuentra es tranquila a la par que pintoresca. Es cierto que no estÃ¡ muy cÃ©ntrico, pero con transporte pÃºblico se llega a todos los sitios rÃ¡pidamente, por lo que no nos supuso un problema. 

AdemÃ¡s, nos llevamos una grata sorpresa con el barrio. La calle Pigneto, estÃ¡ repleta de bares y restaurantes donde cenar o tomar el tÃ­pico ""aperitivi"", en buen ambiente (joven). Por la maÃ±ana, un mercadillo de productos variados, tambiÃ©n da cierta alegrÃ­a. 

Laura nos atendiÃ³ a la perfecciÃ³n, antes y durante la estancia. Ha sido un placer poder disfrutar de su casa y es una pena que, por horarios, no coincidiesemos. QuizÃ¡s la prÃ³xima.

Paula, Valencia. EspaÃ±a."
50385,59286665,2016-01-09,16122341,David,"We stayed in the house for 11 days during last Christmas. It is exactly wat is described in the website, and it was very nice for us to stay there. Besides, Laura nsered to any questions and helped very fast and nicelly.

The house is small and simple, but has everything one needs for some days. The neighbourhood is very interesting, with everal places to try very nice italian food and beers, and there are shops around to buy whatever you need. It is also well communicated with public transport to the centre of the city. 

And Rome is just an extraordinary place to be. So don't hesitate and go!"
50385,69647219,2016-04-12,5348252,Thomas,The neighborhood was great. The appartement is small but convenient. It's a bit humid though and the microwave was not cleaned. There is no wifi either.
50385,72582442,2016-05-03,48034204,Angelo,Il quartiere Ã¨ molto caratteristico e davvero ben collegato con il centro. La casa Ã¨ piccolina ma arredata con stile. L'unico vero problema Ã¨ la mancanza di una porta del bagno. 
50385,74939180,2016-05-17,5972279,Camille,"We had a really nice stay in Rome ! The appartment is located in a very nice & typical area, small street with market & restaurants/snacks. Good connexions with busses. The appartment is quite the same as the description. Just one thing : it was quite humid, the towels were never really dry... Also, the wifi didn't work, we didn't really insist & neither ask Laura so maybe the problem could have been solved. 
Good stay anyway, we sleept well and enjoyed the city ! Thanks !
"
50385,76180822,2016-05-25,47654900,Michael,"Laura's apartment is located a short distance from many of the sights your likely to see, although the Metro C line has not connected Pigneto to San Giovanni yet (which would make this apartment absolutely perfect giving you access to the sights via Metro transit as well as living in a local area largley absent of tourists) there are still other options to get around including by bus and the tram which stops at S. Elena and connects to Roma Termini. I walked from Roma Tuscolana train station after landing at Fiumicino, it was about 20 minutes. The apartment itself is small but is congruent with others in the area, I personally have a lot of experience staying in smaller studio apartments so the lack of space did not concern (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Laura herself was harmonious offering assistance and being available at all times, she's an honest and trustworthy person. Lastly there is a multitude of restaurants and bars in the Pigneto area as well as a decent hamburger shop around the corner. For those who'd prefer to save some money there's a Conad supermarket across the bridge near the Pigneto metro stop, they sell everything you'd usually see in a supermarket back home."
50385,77486902,2016-06-01,12695222,Ben,"Laura ist eine sehr nette Gastgerberin, die Wohnung bzw das Zimmer ist klein, hat jedoch alles was man braucht. "
50385,78085777,2016-06-05,33742563,Pascal,"The positive thing about this place is definitely the location. Around the place there are lots of cool bars and good restaurants to eat. A good area to meet the local people of Rom.
But having said that I wasn't really happy with the conditions of the room. It wasn't really that clean, especially if there are cockroaches in the bathroom. There was no hot water in the shower. Also I had to wait   outside for a friend to bring the key for more than 30min. and he wasn't really welcoming. I expected more for that price."
50385,81507977,2016-06-23,16965932,Manon,"Our stay was lovely.
The studio is small, but it's very cosy and homy.
It's perfect for a short stay in Rome, with all the appliances available.
The neighbourhoud is really quiet, with a market in the morning,  and restaurants opened in the evening to have a nice diner.
I would definetly recommand this place.
Thanks laura.
"
50385,82258357,2016-06-27,39699902,Jos,Super nice stay in LauraÂ´s little apartment! We started of a bit chaoticly coming down from mountains forgetting to fix check-in before. Laura was very helpful and understanding. The place is small but has all you need. You will stay in a pretty much non-turistic place which is really nice after long days of feeling like sheep around colloseum etc. Only minus is public transport from centre can be a nightmare although relatively short distance. New metro line C is on the way but not connected to other lines yet. Cool place - thanks Laura.
50385,92444813,2016-08-08,81699506,Grete,"I loved this place. It was small, but two people don't really need much more space. The book collection was interesting and the kitchen well equiped. The neighbourhood was filled with cool bars and restaurants, the street art was awesome. It was not very quiet at night, but i guess big cities never are. Laura was an amazing host who helped us with everything. I recommend this place to young travellers who want a unique experience."
50385,99981852,2016-09-06,92943351,Deniz,"Even though Laura was away, we had an effective communication and everything went smooth. The flat is tiny as it is seen and the windows are at the pavement level. The terrace is pleasant for smoking and for looking around. Overall, we had a nice stay; easy transportation and lovely neighborhood. Beautiful city after all :)) Recommended."
50385,100887084,2016-09-11,15044503,Yannick,"Top location in Pigneto. The flat is both charming and convenient. 
Laura is a great host, very reliable and flexible on the check in and check out times. She also provides valuable information regarding the good places to eat, shop, etc in the neighbourhood. 
I very much recommend. "
50385,103305373,2016-09-21,36155527,Beatriz,"In spite I never met Laura, all the necessary directions, information, help was there all the time. I was received by a Laura's friend that gave the general information. But Laura has a book with all the things you need to know, not only about the house, but also about the neighborough - restaurants, supermarket, - how to get to the city center, everything. There are also guides, some of them so good that gave me indication where to eat very cheap in the middle of Rome (2 courses meal with wine and coffee for 8 Euros and very good food!). I enjoyed my staying very much, and I thank you, Laura, for allowing me having a good time. Beatriz"
50385,107352150,2016-10-10,3146749,Wylie,"I loved staying in Laura's cute little studio during my solo trip to Rome. It was clean and hip and in an authentic neighborhood with lots of little cafes, restaurants and bars. It was a little off the beaten path, but easily accessible from train, bus and tram, and gave me the opportunity to experience a part of Rome other than the more touristy parts of the city. Laura was easily accessible by text or email once I arrived in Rome. I would definitely return. "
50385,109072237,2016-10-19,4942214,Viktoria,"The apartment is nice. Small, but has everything you need.
Area is non-touristic and sometimes dirty. Specifically
on this street there are many migrants looking unfriendly. I was traveling alone and sometimes feel uncomfortable.
But in general very nice area, a lot of cool bars, restaurants and cafes. 
Not far from the center and train station.
Best way to go to the center is on the bus+metro or tram, because roads usually is a lot of traffic jam."
50385,115034673,2016-11-21,44832811,Alberto,"Estuve 4 dias en lo de Laura , la estadia fue muy agradable y tranquila . El departamento esta bien ubicado se puede recorrer todo caminando . Sin duda volveria !"

50385,144581297,2017-04-16,53128982,Patricio,"I had an awesome time staying at Laura's studio. You can tell she really cares for her guests as everything in the apartment is perfectly laid out to meet your needs. The apartment was very clean. Everything from check in to check out worked great and as expected. The area is extremely well connected with buses and trams just a couple of blocks away which will take you everywhere you want to go in 30 min or less (bus 81 goes to all the historic sites including the Vatican, bus 50 goes to Termini). Laura has a welcome book with many useful instructions and suggestions of all kind. Communication with her was clear and impeccable. What I liked the most about this up and coming area is that I felt like a true Roman going out and about and not like a typical tourist. I was able to dine out in many of the very authentic restaurants surrounding the area and the food was scrumptious! ( my favorites Trattoria Pignetto and Pizza Il Fiorentino). Everyone in the neighborhood was either very nice and friendly or they minded their own business. I would definitely consider staying at this apartment again in the future. "
50385,145977579,2017-04-21,45056819,Jonas,"This tiny apartment is quite perfect to explore the city. Located in a nice quiet area you can find everything you need close to the place. The touristic highlights might be some minutes away by bus, but not too far. The apartment itself is clean and you can find everything you need. It's a little bit dark, because of the small windows, but during a stay in Rome you have a lot of things to see outside. Laura is a very helpful and nice host, thanks for everything! We can warmly recommend this place! We liked it very much."
50385,155589052,2017-05-28,21915333,Katharina,Nice cosy apartement in a very very cool area!
50385,157702931,2017-06-04,117943593,Alec,Good place for the price if only one or two travelers. One bed but it is pretty spacious and can fit two people. The surrounding area is lively with bars and plenty of restaurants. About 20 minutes to downtown. 
50385,160273999,2017-06-13,62780006,Francisco Javier,"Nuestro alojamiento en casa de Laura. No fue como esperamos. Pensabamos que estabamosen la zona de Termini. Y no era a mesi hora de la estaciÃ³n. Estaba sucio( y nosotros aoloibamos a dormir). Habia una fuga de gas en el pasillo, que entiendo que en esto la anfitriona no tiene culpa, pero fue lo que nos encontramos y  sufrimos. Y para terminar,  sabiendo nuestra hora de salida, a las 8 de la maÃ±ana( le dijimps de salir aobre 10:30) escuchamos que intentan abrir la puerta de la casita. Por supuesto, lo primero que que pensamos fue que venian a robar, nos asustamos. Y ya sea porque  venian limpiar o porque iban a robar, ninguna de las dos son correctas."

for us, it was just perfect and we really recommend laura and her apartment!"
50385,172634374,2017-07-21,36448916,Floor,"Laura's place is cosy and nice and the communication with her was perfect.

The kitchen is well equipped to cook a small dinner, the bed is really comfortable and there is a lot of storage space for your suitcase or clothes. Just around the corner there are many bars and restaurants. Pigneto is a wonderful area beside the main tourist hot spots in Rome. I would love to go back as soon as possible! :)
Thanks again for a great time! (Almost forgot: Laura answers extremely quickly and took care of things within hours when something came up! She's the perfect host!)"

Located in a quiet section of Trastevere, the apartment was a great jumping-off point for sightseeing, exploring, and eating.  The space is small, but very cute and clean -- it was so nice to eat breakfast on the terrace every morning, and the expansive DVD/book collection made the room feel very cozy.  The full bathroom isn't pictured, but the shower had good hot water and pressure.  The building has a very green entryway that makes you feel like you're walking into a secret garden -- since you're set back from the main street, it's very quiet.  Steps away from the no. 8 tram that gets you to Piazza Venezia and countless other buses.  Easy walk to Roma Trastevere train station as well.

Finally, Lavinia was a wonderful host.  She was easy to communicate with (no small feat, considering we did not have a cell phone -- or any phone -- in Italy) and checked in throughout our stay.  She left us a few things for our first breakfast, which was a godsend after arriving late and tired.  She also graciously shared her recommendations for eating and non-obvious neighborhood sights.  

We loved Rome as first-time visitors, in no small part due to Lavinia's hospitality.  Highly recommend!"
50471,7611629,2013-09-26,8854520,Eveline,I highly recommend Lavinia's place. Lavinia is very nice and helpfull. The flat is small but nothing is missing and it's very cute. The location is great. Don't eat at the first restaurant close to the apt. Go a little further into Trastevere and you will find there a lot of smal terrasses with restaurants- the best place inRome. I will definetely go back to Lavinia's place
50471,7695640,2013-09-30,7781125,Claire,"Lavinia was a great host with a lovely apartment. She gave us lots of ideas of places to go, including some nice restaurants nearby.  The apartment was exactly like the pictures, tiny but had everything we needed and the terrace was lovely for breakfast or a pre dinner prosecco.
The location is great, a bit of of town but there's a bus and tram which take you only 2 mins walk away so it wasn't an issue.
Thanks for a great stay!"
50471,7982252,2013-10-11,8552345,Dr. Myriam,"This is a wonderful place to stay at. Very clean and quiet; Yet really in walking distance from the centre of Trastevere and even the Vatican. The other places are very good reachable by a direct tram. Although a small appartment, all you need is there. The balcony is very spacious and wonderful to have breakfast or any other meal or drink. I needed to work and the internet was wonderful as well as the spacious table. I will definitely return to this place."

50471,12271961,2014-04-28,11696113,Ziad,"We would have never imagined a better apartment in Rome. It was just perfectly what we needed: charme, charme & charme, even more than the pictures. We stayed, with my wife for 4 nights in Lavinia's apartment. The location is very nice, in the heart of Rome, but at the same time in a very cosy, calm street. The apartment have such positive vibes, it's full of life, of light, colors and of course is comfortable. Also, everything was ready for us, we didn't need anything more to feel at home... thanks Lavinia for this great ""Roman"" experience in the heart of Trastevere. Wish you the best!"

Public transportation is very accessible and necessary from this location. The apartment is on the 3rd floor which was no problem for us. It was very clean with a beautiful sun deck and she provided a map, coffee, fruit, juice, eggs and yogurt in the fridge. 

We had a wonderful time in Rome and the apartment was all we needed. "
50471,21133264,2014-10-12,4939073,Michael,"We stayed at Lavinia's wonderful small apartment with an enchanting roof terrace for 3 nights and felt  wonderful. The apartment was furnished in a wonderful special way. Everything we needed for such a short stay was in the kitchen, (maybe a few wine glasses would be perfect). The bathroom is small but absolutely charming. Especially the roof terrace is perfect (we had wonderful weather). The apartment in Trastevere is very very close to all public transports, so it is easy to explore Rome.
Lavinia was very  friendly and welcomed us perfectly. 
Coming back to Rome we surely would stay here again.

50471,21878823,2014-10-26,15855801,Matt,"A fantastic stay in Roma with an amazing host Lavi! The appt. is absolutely as described with a lovely sun terrace. We really felt part of Roma being in this appt. in a great area Trastevere. Lavi and her friend Filippo were so welcoming, answering all questions, emailing further recommendations which proved so helpful and worthwhile. Lavi even helped arrange a small surprise for my partner which she didn't have to do. It's the littlest things that make all the difference and this made our stay memorable for all the right reasons. Trastevere is very cool, and a break from the busy central area. We loved walking round the cobbled streets, eating and drinking in some amazing places (il Duca and L'orange in trastevere you have to visit!). Roma is so beautiful, we will return and would love to stay here again."

Location was perfect, far enough of away from all the tourist traps but close enough to walk to all that rome has to offer!! The apartment was not only absolutely spotless but was bright, cozy, and had everything you would need, it was like a home away from home! The shower was gorgeous, it had great water pressure (which is very much appreciated after a long day walking every inch of Rome) and the outdoor terrace was just a little piece of heaven, we enjoyed sitting outside in the morning having a cup of coffee planning our assault of rome :) Lavinia is a fantastic host, we got delayed coming from the airport and it was no problem, she was there waiting for us when we arrived. She also gave us some great tips on where to eat and how best to get around rome! We would have been lost without her she made our little romantic trip just absolutely perfect!!! I would definitely recommend both Lavinia as a host and her beautiful studio :) xx"

Conveniently, the apartment on the top floor: a rest in April and nights cool and damp, but in an apartment on the top floor was velikolepno- dry and warm. The landlady gave all the necessary recommendations on routes around the city, which really helped. Thank you, Lavi, for the wonderful four days."

Absolutely no complaints, perhaps the place looks a little smaller than in the photos but it is quite a delight, and the nicest part is the outdoor balcony/terrace which is a treat in Rome.
Thank you for your hospitality. "
50471,34131163,2015-06-05,28469735,Rachael,"The neighborhood was very cute and charming. There were many students studying abroad in the area so it was fun to connect with them. Everything was walkable... we walked to every major Roman site from the apartment (tram was also easy to use). 

The space was very cute, fully equipped and clean! The back deck was a major plus for an evening glass of wine! 

Our favorite experience was the interactive tour of Romus Domane. It is a newly discovered ancient ruin Roman home... really fascinating!!"
50471,34428875,2015-06-08,12414217,Sergio,"Lavinias apartment is as described. It is a small, lovely and cosy place in Trastevere, which is one of the best areas in Rome. The apartment is in a small street, so it is quite calm and you can enjoy the terrace. From here you can easily discover Rome - even by feet. 
Check-in was supereasy, same as check-out. Lavinia provided everything we needed and the apartment is fully equipped. She even gave us some tips where to go out at night (restaurants, etc), which is great, if you do not know well the area you live in."

Lavinia was helpful all the time by message and recmmended us good places to have dinner and hangout. The appartment was in good conditions, everything was clean and the terrace was really niceto the hot days we spent in Rome. The appartment is near the centre and ww walked everyday to the centre, didn't use any transports but there are transports near the appartment as well. I would recommed this place! Thank you Lavinia!"
50471,35083119,2015-06-15,30973315,Sandra,"The house was really bright and cozy well equipped and clean. The patio also perfect when starting the day with a coffee or after a long day walk through Rome. The location was perfect, all the highlights are perfectly reached by foot. Keep in mind that the place is at the 2nd floor and that there are quite some stairs. In case you have problems walking. Communication was great with Lavinia except that we both had problems receiving each other's messages during our stay."
50471,35917164,2015-06-23,17951500,Onno,Thank you for the extra service and suggestions during our stay. Pleasant cosy appartment. Great terrace and excellent bakery/lunch at 50 meters.
50471,36273558,2015-06-27,23950902,Joseph,"What a nice little apartment to spend some relaxing time in after a long day walking the historical parts of Rome. Lavinia, your apartment had every amenity needed for a comfortable stay. Thank you so much for sharing your home with my wife and I. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, especially the solar lantern lit terrace filled with flowers. I do suggest studying the local transportation (bus and trams) from Trastevere to downtown areas, unless you don't mind a walk (about 45 min to Colosseum and Vatican). We were able to do it with little to no trouble at all. I would highly recommend Lavinia's apartment to anyone!"
50471,37661558,2015-07-09,26221181,Chanelle,Absolutely amazing stay! Cozy apartment with a lovely balconey. Great area if you wish to stay away from the obviously touristy areas. She provided a few snacks as well as plenty of recommendations of places to eat and drink.
50471,38113743,2015-07-13,2175681,Philipp,"Lavinias apartment is awesome. We had a wonderful time and enjoyed our trip to Rome pretty much. 

When you enter the location you enter a small urban jungle in the middle of the city. The terrance on the top is lovely and perfect to spend the night on a warm summer night. Thanks to the a/c itÂ´s nice an cold inside. Everything is tidy, the fridge is big and the kitchen good equipped. 

The trip to most sights only takes a few minutes by tram or bus. Anything within Trastevere is in a short waking distance. Testaccio is also pretty close by, and a lot of food places are anyway just a few meters from the apartment. As most sights a pretty packed with tourists itÂ´s quite nice to have a chilled environment in the back of Trastevere. 

We didnÂ´t met Lavinia but a friend gave us a good intro to the apartment. Lavinia gave us some good restaurant tips and even helped to organize a transfer to the airport pretty early.  

Rome + Trastevere + Lavinias Apartment are a pretty god match :) "

50471,39491239,2015-07-24,32689749,George,"The flat was perfect. It looked exactly like the photos. Lavinia was great, before we went to Rome she sent us a great long list of restaurants and bars around the city and filled us in with all the info we needed. Unfortunately we were unable to meet her but she arranged for us to be let in by a friend which worked out fine.

The flat itself was exactly as advertised and on arrival it was lovely and clean. It was close to the buzzing centre of Trastevere and thanks to Lavi's recommendations we had some excellent meals. It was close enough to the metro line and the tram went from right outside.

While being just outside town there was no noise and it was a great place to unwind after a long day of sight seeing. The only fault I could find was the patio doors, I could not seem to lock them. This didn't really worry me though as I was confident that it was in a safe area and we'll tucked away.

One last thing to note is the fantastic garden kept by the man on the ground floor. It was beautiful to walk through every morning as we left!"

L'appartamento Ã¨ splendido e accogliente, dai colori chiari e perfettamente arredato con gusto..una gioia per gli occhi. Il terrazzino Ã¨ il tocco in piÃ¹ a tutto l'appartamento. La mattina successiva al nostro arrivo, infatti,non abbiamo esitato un attimo a prendere dei cornetti giganti dal fornaio sotto casa e goderci la colazione sul terrazzo. 
Ã stato davvero un soggiorno perfetto, e se c'Ã¨ ne sarÃ  la possibilitÃ , torneremo sicuramente da Lavinia!"
50471,40207686,2015-07-29,32078454,Greg,"Thoroughly enjoyed the flat. The A/C was a treat after being in the heat of the day. Great location just on the edge of trendy Trastevere where there are many restaurants, shops, etc. Bus stops 50 m away to get you into a couple of different areas of Rome and the underground Metro. Fantastic bakery on the corner for pastries and coffee. Lavinia provided excellent recommendations for local area restaurants which made dinner plans easier at the end of the day. Would recommend and stay here again next time Iâm in Rome. Thank you!"

Lavinia texted us a great long list of restaurants and bars around the city; She was constantly in touch, making sure everything was ok.
The apartment is as described and away from the touristy area, but only a short walk to the center of Trastevere, which is always full of life! Public transport is nearby and taxis to the center of Rome are not that expensive either.
We certainly enjoyed our stay here since we spent most of our nights enjoying Trastevereâs night life!

50471,44098781,2015-08-24,6449882,Erin,"My boyfriend & I stayed at this gorgeous flat in Trastevere at the end of our Europe trip.
Lavinia was unable to meet us at the flat, but we had plenty of communication leading up to arrival. She was super helpful, giving tips/advice for restaurants & transport around Rome.
She arranged for her friend to meet us on time & let us in!  We were so happy to find the loft to be exactly as described & shown in pictures.  We felt so at home!  She had everything there we needed & it had a really warm feel to it.
The loft is literally 5-10min walk to the heart of Trastevere, trendy bars, restaurants & shops.  This was our favourite area in Rome, slightly boho feel to it & plenty of locals.
We didn't meet Lavinia in person but she was lovely & ever so helpful prior/post visit!
I'd highly recommend this place :) So beautiful for escaping the hustle & bustle of the busy city!
Grazie Lavinia!

Small but very nice bathroom with an excellent hot shower. Well equipped kitchen, with everything you could need. The bed is very comfortable and, as the loft doesn't overlook the main road, it was very quiet at night. 

There is a tram stop nearby for easy access to all the sights (which are also within walking distance if you are feeling energetic). A great local bakery does the nicest pastries I have ever tasted!! 

We were greeted by Lorenzo, a friend of Lavinia's. He was very careful to ensure that we felt settled and informed about the loft and travel to the sights, and he let us know that if we had any queries, to contact him. A great place to stay."

50471,56968032,2015-12-20,50304779,Semih,"lavinia's apartment is the place you can (Email hidden by Airbnb) is only 10 min walk to train station ( fiumicino airport) ,its an easy 30 min walk to the coloseum.couldnt meet with lavinia but her friend lorenzo was helpfull."
50471,58996196,2016-01-05,8000027,Maria,"I didn't meet Lavinia, but Lorenzo, he was great, and very welcoming. The apartment is very cozy, very quiet but in a lively neighborhood at a walking distance to all major attractions."
50471,60130236,2016-01-19,40239214,Anna,"It was a great experience. All the photos and descriptions of apartment given were thuth.Lavinia always helpful before and after check in. She gave us good advice with eateries around the apartment.
Will recommend to anyone who wants to stay in Trastevere.
"
50471,60570265,2016-01-25,49299484,Ramiro,"We arrived the apartment easily through the instructions Lavinia gave us, from Fiumicino Airport just 30 minutes by train. We kept in touch with Lavinia and upon our arrival Alicia was waiting for us, she greeted us and gave great indications of the district, the apartment and the activities we could do on the days we were there. 
Arriving at the apartment we realized we had made the right decision staying there. Exactly the same as published in the pictures, bright, clean, well equipped and super comfortable. 
We are very happy to have discovered this gem in Trastevere, a very quiet and peaceful apartment, but a short distance from Trastevere great nightlife (bars, restaurants). Just a minute from the tram that takes you to Piazza Venezia, and from there to anywhere in the city. If you want to walk, you can do it from the apartment, since you're 25 minutes away from the main tourist points of the city. 
If we return to Rome without a doubt we would rent LaviniaÂ´s apartment again, it is the perfect place to spend a good holiday!"
50471,61158798,2016-02-01,49299484,Ramiro,"Arribamos al departamento muy fÃ¡cil a travÃ©s de las indicaciones que nos habÃ­a brindado Lavinia, desde el aeropuerto Fiumicino a solo 30 minutos en tren. Nos mantuvimos en contacto con Lavinia y al arribar nos esperaba Alicia, quien nos atendiÃ³ super bien y nos diÃ³ indicaciones del barrio, del departamento y de las actividades que podÃ­amos hacer en los dÃ­as que estuvieramos allÃ­.
Al llegar al departamento nos dimos cuenta que habÃ­amos tomado la acertada decisiÃ³n de alojarnos allÃ­. Exactamente igual a lo publicado en las fotos, luminoso, limpio, muy bien equipado y super cÃ³modo.
La verdad es que estamos muy contentos de haber descubierto esta joya en Trastevere, un departamento muy silencioso y tranquilo, pero a escasa distancia del movimiento propio del Trastevere (bares, restaurantes y hermosa movida nocturna). 
A solo un minuto de la parada del tranvÃ­a que te lleva a Piazza Venezia, y desde allÃ­ a cualquier punto de la ciudad. Si tenÃ©s ganas de caminar, podes hacerlo desde el departamento mismo, ya que estÃ¡s a 25 minutos de los principales puntos turÃ­sticos de la ciudad.
De volver a Roma sin dudas que alquilariamos nuevamente el departamento de Lavinia, es el lugar perfecto para pasar unas buenas vacaciones!"
50471,63488540,2016-02-23,37547284,Morad,"Nous avons passÃ© un sÃ©jour trÃ¨s agrÃ©able. L'appartement de Lavinia est charmant et bien situÃ©. De plus, elle a Ã©tÃ© tout au long de notre sÃ©jour de trÃ¨s bon conseil et disponible! 
Merci beaucoup."
50471,64235218,2016-03-01,2265202,Emmanuel,"Perfect place for a couple - cute, nice terrace, very good kitchen and bathroom. The building is quiet and well connected to tramway and buses."
50471,64520752,2016-03-05,43036145,Kristal,This was the perfect cozy apartment outside of the main city of Rome.  It was an easy tram ride into the central touristy and there were many restaurants and cafes in walking distance.  Lavinia kept in constant contact about our arrival and made sure everything was perfect.  We would highly recommend this listing and can't wait to visit Rome again.
50471,67165337,2016-03-27,16423981,Villy,"We stayed at Lavinia's apartment 4 days and we loved it! It is a beautiful apartment in  an amazing building with a lovely aura, clean, tidy with all comforts available and exactly as portrayed in the pictures. (for movie lovers: It also provides a great selection of dvd's to watch - if you decide to spend a night in). The location is great, with local shops, restaurants and transport links on your doorstep. Walking distance from vibrant Trastevere too. Both Filippo,who let us in, and Lavinia are very helpful and available to give advice about the area, eateries and things to do.

We had a fantastic stay and would definitely recommend."
50471,68345340,2016-04-04,49039054,Julie,"We LOVED our stay at Lavinia's appartment. La ""casa de la luz"" really deserves its name. It is full of light all day long, the terrace was just lovely on these first spring days, and the street is quiet but still relatively close to the center, and to the heart of Trastevere.
Lavinia was very helpful with everything and responded quickly to any request we had. I really appreciated her flexibility with our arrival and departure times, too. We definitely would love to come back. "
50471,68713666,2016-04-06,45095717,Matthew,"Lavinia was very helpful,and friendly. She offered advice on our trip. The flat was as described; cosy and comfortable."
50471,68990401,2016-04-08,1629973,LÃ©a,"TrÃ¨s chouette appartement, lumineux, bons conseils de l'hÃ´te!"
50471,70737076,2016-04-20,23031629,Isabelle,"Our stay in Lavinas apartment was just perfect!  First of all, Lavina is a great host - very friendly and prompt in answers and any help which could be needed!!!!!  She gave us even in advance of our stay very good tips of restaurants and places to visit and gave us a very warm welcome at our arrival!!! 
The apartment is just gorgeous with LIGHT allover!!!! Everything was clean and comfy! We immediately felt at home and each morning we enjoyed our breakfast on the terrace with goodies from the bakery just around the corner! Everything is in walking distance (for those who don't mind a little stroll to the big touristic places) or you just hopp on the tram and you are right in the middle of everything in no time!!! We give a definite recommendation to stay at Lavinas place and if we will visit Rome again - we will for sure try to stay in this lovely apartment with that great host again!!!!!"
50471,70885887,2016-04-21,29016674,Sestino,"Carinissimo appartamento immerso nel verde, silenzioso e luminoso, con tutti i confort, accogliente e spazioso. Lavinia Ã¨ gentilissima, simpatica e disponibile."
50471,71571952,2016-04-26,24855999,Mieke,It is a nice and quiet appartement on a perfect location. Well equipted and lavinia gave us a warm welcome. We can recommand this appartement for everybody who want to visit Rome 
50471,71750296,2016-04-28,20594254,Gili,"the place is really welcoming and very well located (we liked it being a 10 minutes walk from the main touristic area but still fills like Rome)
the host was very helpful and kind.
for sure recommended !!!!
enjoy!"
50471,72999905,2016-05-06,68386260,Annika,"A proper and welcoming check in to this lovely and well equipped apartment. The location is very good if you want to visit the famous attractions of Rome. 
We would love to come back to Rome and hopefully will Lavinas Loft be available."
50471,73777201,2016-05-10,3652192,Jessica,"We loved our stay in Roma! Trastevere is the cutest neighborhood and you're out of the tourist noisy part of town. Lavi's place is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. Very cute and perfect for a couple. Lavi was so easy to communicate with and always responded very promptly when we needed her help.   The apartment is on the top floor, so pack lightly or be ready to carry your things up a few flight of stairs. The terrace is adorable.  I enjoyed my morning cafe out there! I would definitely recommend this place and would absolutely stay here again when we return to Rome! 
Thanks again Lavi!"
50471,75631376,2016-05-22,27559518,Valarie,"Lavi is very friendly and welcoming! She is very communicative with directions from the airport, restaurant recommendations, and info regarding the apartment. We loved the Trastevere neighborhood!  The apartment was bright and clean and in a perfect location to access all points of interest, including the bus and tram.  Access to everything was so close but the apartment was nice and quiet. "
50471,76659144,2016-05-28,3349614,Marc,Lavinia's apartment was great - clean and convenient. She was very communicative and helpful 
50471,77677633,2016-06-02,24543137,Laurie,"Lavina's apartment was just what we needed for our time in Rome. Cute patio, and very close to the bus/tram stop as well as some good restaurants. Getting to and from the tourist areas was very easy from here! We left our window and patio door open at night and woke up to the beautiful sounds of birds singing. We felt so far away from a big city, but we were so close. "
50471,78750511,2016-06-08,65107820,Simona,"Lavinia 's cozy loft was indeed very cozy! Exactly what I needed at the end of my trip! It is so very safe and far away enough from touristy places that you can rest and soak in the life of the city! 
Lavinia was the perfect host; the most helpful host I encountered throughout all my two week stay in Italy. She even came and picked me up! So gracious! She gave great recommendations and was very available and kind! Take her recommendations because she knows the area so well; go to the Orange Gardens and do look through the keyhole:) I hope I get to go back!"
50471,81061291,2016-06-20,7343268,Frances,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Lavinia's small but cosy apartment. It has all the basics and gave us a comfortable foothold in Rome. It was light and airy and the terrace garden with a green outlook is a real plus. The location is genuinely interesting and not touristy. However, a short walk takes you to the some of the best eating in Rome. Not luxury but genuine value. Be prepared for Roman drains!"
50471,81730634,2016-06-24,17214629,Annie,"We absolutely loved our stay here!! It's conveniently located in a great neighborhood, and the apartment was beautiful and perfect for our needs. Loved it!"
50471,82747115,2016-06-29,11319649,Elisabeth,"We had a really nice time in Rome and in LaviniaÂ´s flat! I can really recommand that place! also the area is really nice, not too central (a few tramway stations to the historic part) and really calm at night! Lavinia is a very nice host and ambitious about giving good advices on where to have good food! thanks al lot! 
"
50471,84929644,2016-07-09,77810390,Laura,"This sweet little apartment is in the perfect area of Rome so you feel like you are living there. Quiet spot. There is easy close access to local buses & trams. We loved the apt & terrace and the AV made it a comfortable place to sleep in the summer (hard to come by sometimes in Europe!). Lavinia made sure someone was there to meet us & hand over keys and explain the specifics of the place, and we meet Lavinia when we checked out.  She even accommodated us to hold our luggage for an extra hour while we grabbed a late breakfast at our favorite spot on the corner. Lovely experience & I would definitely stay there again!"
50471,85904874,2016-07-13,30868017,Floria,"We had a wonderful time at the loft. It was perfect for our needs, while being clean, cozy and bright. Lavinia was very easy to communicate with and very friendly, giving us advice on her favorites places to eat in Rome. In addition, she let us check in early while Lorenzo was still cleaning the place (thank you, Lorenzo!). We loved having coffee in the Terrace, make sure you get pastries around the corner. And if anyone is interested, my husband who studies birds, left the names of the species we saw on the balcony. Thank you, Lavinia for a great experience. We hope to come back!
Floria and Al"
50471,86863320,2016-07-17,24921964,Nicole,"Bereits vor der Ankunft hat Lavinia alles getan, um uns einen angenehmen Aufenthalt zu ermÃ¶glichen. Angefangen von der Anfahrtsbeschreibung Ã¼ber spezielle SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten bis hin zu tollen Restaurant- und Bar-Tipps.
Die Wohnung ist genau wie beschrieben und die Lage einfach phÃ¤nomenal.
Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen und es lief alles reibungslos.
Falls wir wieder einmal nach Rom kommen, wÃ¼rden wir gerne wieder hier wohnen.
Vielen Dank fÃ¼r alles. :)"
50471,87437251,2016-07-20,81021124,Sean,Lavinia went above & beyond in ensuring our stay was comfortable & well received. She even coordinated with other hosts to find us another place to stay after we decided to extend our time in Rome. 
50471,88265081,2016-07-23,18608866,Mariam,"It was such a pleasure to stay in Lavi's apartment. She was super helpful even before we came to Italy, and was always there to answer questions and give us recommendations. The apartment itself is very clean and perfect for 2 people. The location is absolutely perfect! It is a very safe area and we never felt threatened at all, even walking at night. The apartment is tucked in a quiet street away from the craziness of Trastevere, but was very close to everything. We took the #8 tram everyday, and it saved us a lot of walking. There is a cute caffe right by the apartment that has amazing cappuccinos. And the restaurant L'orange is about a 5 minute walk from the apartment and it is amazing. Best food we have had in Rome (the fettuccine is amazing). We really enjoyed our time in Lavi's apartment and we will definitely come back here on our next trip to Rome."
50471,88973604,2016-07-26,72394818,Laurie,"The loft was charming and full of accommodations such as coffee, good movies to watch, and a sweet terrace to enjoy breakfast. Better than a hotel. Easily accessible to trams or taxis. Lavinia checked in and it was nice to know she was available even though we didn't request much help once we got there. The old iron door to the lovely garden was a bit of a challenge, but all else was sweet!"
50471,89715642,2016-07-29,56376597,Jimi,This is an awesome stay if you are looking for the local feel of Rome. The food is amazing and walking distance to the Trastevere markets. Easy access to the 75 bus that will take you straight to the Colosseum. The Vitican is only 2.5 away and a nice walk if you like to enjoy the scenery. Lavi is a very nice person and easy to communicate with. Pictures look exactly like her place.   
50471,93614216,2016-08-13,29041691,Raphael,"Laviana est une hÃ´te attentionÃ©e et arrangeante dans toutes situations. L'appartement est vraiment mignon, trÃ¨s propre et la terrasse est idÃ©ale. Je recommande cet appartement +++++"
50471,97107882,2016-08-26,87141361,Kim,"Fantastic location on bus and tram lines but very quiet unit facing lovely hill, lots of natural light, air conditioned, nice home base to return to but not really to hang out in. "
50471,98512666,2016-08-31,80633375,Sabine,"Die Unterkunft war noch schÃ¶ner und gemÃ¼tlicher als erwartet. Allein der Eingang ist wunderschÃ¶n, auch wenn uns das alte Tor gelegentlich fast zur Verzweiflung brachte. Es dauert einfach ein bisschen, bis man versteht wie es auf und zu gemacht werden muss :) danach muss man durch einen kleinen grÃ¼nen Dschungel, durch eine alte HolztÃ¼r und dann noch eine Treppe hoch, bis man in der kleinen aber sehr feinen Wohnung ist. Die Klimaanlage war im August Gold wert und sie kÃ¼hlt wirklich schnell runter. Auch die kleine Dachterrasse ist perfekt fÃ¼r ein gemÃ¼tliches FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck oder ein GlÃ¤schen Wein am Abend. In der KÃ¼che ist alles da zum Kochen, das Bad ist sauber und auch sonst ist alles da, was man braucht. Lavinia hat uns im Vorfeld wirklich gute Tipps fÃ¼r SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten,Bars und Restaurants gegeben und hat sich freundlich auch mal erkundigt, ob alles so weit passt. Sie ist wirklich eine gute Gastgeberin. Einzig der Weg zu den SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten war zum Teil etwas lang, was in der Hitze manchmal wirklich anstrengend war.  
Auf jeden Fall ist die Wohnung eine gute Wahl :) "
50471,100737634,2016-09-10,5659642,Robert,"Lavinia's apartment was very nice. It had everything we needed. We really appreciated the air conditioning that we used in the late afternoon for our trip in early September. We had to leave very early for our flight when checking out. Lavinia graciously ordered a private car to take us to FCO at 05:30 in the morning at a good rate. 

We found a large Conad grocery in the basement of a QVS department store 2 stops north on the #8 tram. There are several small Conad stores but this one is a real super market. We also found a full service laundry ""Lavachiuga"" one stop south on either the #8 or #3 tram. Although the #8 tram is most useful taking you to the hip places in Trastevere, and Piazza Venezia, the #3 tram will take you to the Coliseum and to the metro lines A and B. Be sure when you are checking in that you are shown how to open and close the gate. You need to do it yourself while they watch. It can be tricky. "
50471,101446038,2016-09-13,51035306,Marissa,"This was a great place for our stay in Rome. It was the perfect size and had everything we needed. In a walkable location to most major sites, but not super close. "
50471,103623041,2016-09-23,1157306,Bianca,"Lavinia was super-helpful in preparing me for my arrival in Rome and to her flat. Her instructions to get to the flat were very thorough and easy to follow. Then she made it easy to drop my luggage into the flat a bit earlier than suggested time as I had an early flight coming in from the US. 

Lavinia provided a comprehensive list of recommended restaurants and bars from different neighborhoods in Rome. She also was quick to answer to smaller questions I had regarding tap water in Rome and other similarly related questions.

With regards to the accommodation itself, the flat was super-cozy, with a very comfortable bed. It was big enough for two people to share on a first trip to Rome. They also prepared it with some light snacks and breakfast as well as some bottled water and a nice beer/bottle of wine.

Overall, I do recommend this loft for a stay in Rome, especially if you don't mind walking to the central parts of Rome (~ 20-25 min walk to the piazzas)."
50471,104288732,2016-09-26,72355083,Nicole,"Obstkorb zum Willkommen, netter und pÃ¼nktlicher Empfang."
50471,105294536,2016-10-01,2115862,John,"We really enjoyed our stay here.  It is in a great location, not in the heart of Rome, but within easy walking and tram distance.  The neighborhood of Trastevere is great, many charming cobbled streets with restaurants and plazas, a great place to go for a stroll after dinner.  The apartment itself is on a tiny side street, so it is very quiet at night.  Having the outdoor terrace is great, and the building faces a hill in the direction of the terrace, which makes it feel very private.  Lavinia was very responsive with suggestions and answers to questions.  "
50471,106775429,2016-10-08,30921742,Paul,Lavinia's flat is cute and comfortable.  It is located on a quiet street in a lovely neighborhood with easy access to public transport.  The whole experience was very easy and convenient.
50471,107109806,2016-10-09,98333988,Katia,This is a very cozy place in Trastere. One has the impression to be at home. Very bright with all necessary amenities. Easy to access from Fiumicino airport and all main tourist attractions are at walking distance. I would definitely recommend this place for your trips to Rome. 
50471,109561190,2016-10-22,14029252,Noelia,"La estancia ha sido inmejorable, Lavinia mostrÃ³ un gran interÃ©s porque nos sintiÃ©ramos bien. La casa estÃ¡ genial, fue todo un detalle encontrarnos con todo lo imprescindible para un buen desayuno y Roma cumpliÃ³ todas nuestras expectativas. Es la ciudad del amor!!
Gracias Lavinia y Andrea"
50471,111494969,2016-10-31,36368339,BÃ©nÃ©dicte,The flat is well placed closed to transports and a very nice area to go out in the evening : Trastevere. We had a nice WE and Lavinia gave us very good tips and advice. The flat is nice and calm. 
50471,114146458,2016-11-16,6729347,Imola,"Great location! Great, local neighbourhood, quiet, peaceful, everything easily reachable. Cozy, comfortable and clean apartment! Small, but everything has its place. Comfortable beds. Lavinia is very friendly and responsive. She gave us a very detailed guide with fantastic recommendations! And she helped us to overlay till our late evening flight back.
Good internet connection. (During our stay Lavinia changed the internet to unlimited data usage. It was 1GB per day before)"
50471,121838347,2016-12-19,59939359,Arnaldo,"Grazie Lavinia, siamo stati benissimo la casa ci e' piaciuta molto arredata con amore e piena di dvd uno piu' bello dell'altro. Speriamo di tornare presto un grande abbraccio Arnaldo e Laura."

The centre of Rome is in walking distance, and public transport is very close by. We did not meet Lavinia in person, but she was very helpful (by email) and gave us a lot of information and tips for restaurants and bars. I definitely recommend this place."
50471,127155854,2017-01-16,47049679,Maria,The apartment is really cozy and nice. Everything looks as itâs shown on the photos. Very good infrastructure&transportation but we preferred walking. There was so authentical and amazing courtyard!!! We really liked it! I would recommend the apartment of Lavinia to my friends. Thanks Lavinia.

50471,139407158,2017-03-25,13184772,Monika,"Die Wohnung war nett und freundlich eingerichtet und dekoriert. Was sehr angenehm war, es hatte Kaffee und Tee , sogar Teigwaren etc. sodass man sich etwas kochen hÃ¤tte kÃ¶nnen. BÃ¼cher und viele Filme standen zur VerfÃ¼gung. Es machte den Eindruck, dass die Besitzerin  fÃ¼r ein paar Tage verreist ist und die Wohnung zur VerfÃ¼gung gestellt hat. Eigentlich sehr sympatisch. Leider besuchten ein paar Ameisen die KÃ¼che, das war nicht so angenehm. Auch der Ausblick der Terasse auf die danebenliegende war nicht sehr erfreulich. FÃ¼r einen Aufenthalt zu den SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten im Zentrum von Rom fÃ¼r mich etwas zu weit entfernt. Jedoch insgesamt fÃ¼r die 3 Tage ein angenehmer Aufenthalt. "
50471,140183181,2017-03-28,120156726,Christian,This was a very nice place to stay.  The neighborhood is safe and quiet.  The loft is the perfect size for a couple.  The apartment has everything you need in a cozy setting and the outside terrace is very relaxing.  This was the last place we stayed in Italy and it was a great spot to finish our trip.  We loved the movie selection!
50471,142415007,2017-04-08,2503193,Lauren,"Lavinia's home was the perfect stay for anyone looking for an authentic experience within the best district of Rome. The flat was filled with sunlight every day, with the bed overlooking the terrace which is filled with herbs and plant pots - beautiful to enjoy coffee in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening. The flat itself is situated in a very quiet road within Trastevere - a short walk to all the cool bars and restaurants. To enter the flat you walk though a beautiful garden and once you're in, you have everything you need for your stay. Lavinia was super easy to communicate with, and I would recommend anyone to stay. Thanks again for having us "
50471,144259614,2017-04-15,24327996,Julia,"We had a wonderful week in Rome, the appartment is really close to the tram station (it takes about 40 minutes from the Airport), you can easily walk to the center of Trastevere and to the city center of Rome (Pantheon, Piazza Navona). The terrasse is great, we had breakfast and aperitivo outside. The communication with Lavinia was perfect and easy. We recommand the appartment!

50471,145653651,2017-04-19,122276544,Paul,"We enjoyed our stay Lavinia's Place. It had everything we needed, the beds were quite comfortable, it was cheerfully decorated and it was rather quiet. We liked the patio.  Enjoyed the nearby deli. It was handy to the number 8 tram and the Roma Trastevere train station. We appreciated  the responsive emails in setting up a car service to the airport. We would recommend it to our friends. "
50471,147345923,2017-04-26,41281406,Ralph,"Brightness and light gave loft a nice ambience. Garden entrance really nice. And many thanks for the purchase of Nespresso machine, very nice of Lavi knowing I had asked about it. Nice amenities, food, treats, etc were nice. Outside patio with plants was a major reason for choosing loft, and the brightness mentioned earlier. Thanks also for info on area (restaurants, etc) and the Vespa rental."
50471,148549205,2017-05-01,49335853,Jennyfer,"We had a wonderfull time. Lavinia's place Will provide you with all confort ! Beautifull Light, terrasse and great location !

50471,149470686,2017-05-04,126176534,James,Went here because of proximity to our sons apt who is studying in Rome.  Great area for restaurants and bars.  Plus short walk to most of the major sites.  
50471,151133803,2017-05-11,125963890,Carole,Stayed for 4 days  in Lavinias cosy loft and found it to be exactly as described we were not disappointed.  It was so bright and airey and had such a peaceful energy we loved to return in the evening and sit on the little terrace which is filled with flower pots. The apartment had every thing that was needed for our stay and was in a perfect location for trams and buses and no where was too far to walk . Lavinia gives great advice and tips of places to see and eat and we did the self check in which was made really easy with the instructions.would love to stay again. 
50471,154146786,2017-05-23,42598575,Susannah,"Wow! Lavinia's place was perfect for our romantic honeymoon in Rome. Very easy to check in and she even helped us arrange transport from the airport. Trestivera is a beautiful neighbourhood and we felt lucky to be so close to such lovely restaurants!

The terrace is ideal for relaxing after a long day sight seeing... highly recommend you stay here."
50471,154824096,2017-05-26,10888853,Caroline,"This is a beautiful, quiet apartment with great light, and a wonderful balcony for meals when the weather is nice. Restaurants, bars, shops, and good sightseeing are all within walking distance. Lavinia is a great host and I'd highly recommend this spot to anyone! "
50471,156583726,2017-05-31,90821044,Floriana,Lavinia Ã¨ stata molto disponibile e l'alloggio Ã¨ stato sia piacevole che accolgiente.

50471,158272089,2017-06-06,26246850,Jennie,"What a wonderful time we had at Lavinia's lovely home!  The space is beautiful and comfortable and full of light.  Lavinia provided us with SO MANY wonderful options for where to eat and what not to miss - our only regret is that we only were able to spend 2 days in Rome.  I would highly recommend booking her home if you are able.  It is in a great neighborhood and close to everything.  As it was our first time in Rome, I had so many questions and Lavinia was always so quick to respond, both before and during our trip.  I hope to be able to return to Rome in the near future and hope Lavinia's lovely cozy home will be available.  Grazie Mille!  :) "
50471,160307774,2017-06-13,75135,Alison,"Laviniaâs apartment is an excellent choice for a visit to Rome.  Trestervere is a beautiful neighbourhood and an easy and scenic walk to all of the main attractions. 

The apartment is perfect for a couple. The windows and terrace make it bright, light and very welcoming. Lavinia was very quick to respond to any questions and check in and out was very efficient. Great value and I highly recommend."
50471,162974300,2017-06-23,4470328,Taylor,"Lavi's studio apartment was perfect for our stay in Rome.  Lavi is one of the best hosts I've ever had.  She is completely prepared with everything; she provided directions to her house from the airport; gave us detailed check in instructions with pictures on how to find the lock boxes and codes for the gated apartment building; a HUGE list of her favorite restaurants in her area and other areas of Rome;  a HUGE list of sites she said we must see and public transit details.   Her apartment is totally charming and majestic, from her beautiful curtains that give the apartment a calming hue during the sunny afternoon, to her extensive movie and book collection, fully equipped kitchen, and beautiful garden balcony outside the flat.  Very comfortable bed and big couch.  We loved everything and it was bitter sweet to leave. Anyone who finds this place should consider it a lucky find.  Thank you Lavi, Ciao. "
50471,166681347,2017-07-04,123503002,Chandler,"Lavinia's place was well secluded from the outside noise of the city, yet very near the nightlife and vibrant options of trastevere. "

50471,169602624,2017-07-13,74153774,Lucy,"Lavinia's apartment is lovely and bright. The building and space itself is  really charming, homely and lots of attention to detail.

There's loads of DVDs to watch if you like a night in but Trastevere is not too far away and it's lovely just wondering the streets. It's a very vibrant part of the city and we preferred it to the centre in many ways! 

Thanks for having us Lavinia!"

50471,183827147,2017-08-18,65328848,Sandro,"Il loft di Lavina Ã¨ strepitoso! A due passi da viale di Trastevere solitamente trafficato, ti accoglie invece in unâatmosfera ovattata la cui colonna sonora Ã¨ eseguita dalle cicale del parco di villa Sciarra.
Arredato con criterio ed eleganza nei minimi dettagli, Ã¨ un posto ideale dove spendere una vacanza sentendosi come a casa propria. Delizioso il terrazzino ornato di piante e fiori magnificamente curati.
Inoltre Lavinia si Ã¨ rivelata cortese e premurosa nel fornire indicazioni e consigli.
Assolutamente consigliato!"

Lavinia was fantastic for communicating with us before we came over and was very responsive with any messages or queries we had. The whole process was clearly outlined and was simple and quick. The apartment itself was lovely and it was such a pleasure to come back to it after a long day! The air conditioner was also a huge plus considering the heat. All in all, we would highly recommend the apartment to anyone interested!"

Also convenient to Conad supermarket, bakeries, and the medical clinic for tourists. And we walked everywhere: most major sites less than. 30 minute walk. Clean, convenient, and above all: charming."
50471,192745028,2017-09-11,93628228,Wendy,Very nice place. Reasonable price if you want your own space and not a shared space. Tram is right outside the apartment. We mostly walked because that's what we like to do. Many amazing places to explore in the area. Love the terrace and yummy bakery and cafe on the corner. I recommend!

50471,201372896,2017-10-08,24112681,Nick,"Lavinia's flat is cosy and ideal for couples looking to locate themselves in a buzzy, safe neighbourhood with plenty of nightlife, while still being only a short journey to all the sights of Rome. Check-in / out was very simple and Lavinia was always easy to get hold of. She also had plenty of recommendations for restaurants and things to do. Would definitely recommend this flat for a long weekend or short stay in Rome!"

50471,215508830,2017-11-30,25605217,Rebecca,"Laviniaâs studio was as pictured: clean, well laid out with a nice sized restroom and living room, with wonderful daylight (with blackout shades!), as well as a terrace which would be ideal in the warmer seasons.  We enjoyed walking around Trastevere (thereâs an awesome park behind the apartment) and the many restaurants and bars all within a 15-20 minute walk.  As a host, Lavinia was quick to respond and attentive to our questions."

50471,230424868,2018-01-28,24620803,Tommaso,"Sono di Roma ed ho soggiornato con la mia ragazza presso il loft di Lavinia per un week end. Devo dire che Ã¨ difficile trovare a Roma un appartamento cosÃ¬ ben curato, con arredamento particolarmente accogliente ed in una posizione centrale (se non si hanno mezzi propri, consigliabile motorino, Ã¨ possibile raggiungere il centro in pochi minuti con la linea 8 del tram). Da notare anche la presenza di uno spazio esterno (terrazzino), per noi fondamentale. 
Inoltre Lavinia Ã¨ stata disponibilissima, accogliendoci al check in e venendoci incontro su una nostra piccola esigenza al check out.
Se dovessi averne necessitÃ  in futuro ci tornerÃ² sicuramente!"
50471,232790851,2018-02-06,40968267,Sara,Great plAce in a great location.
50471,233876787,2018-02-11,23900208,Angie,"My husband and I stayed at Laviniaâs flat during a short weekend trip to Rome. It was bright and lovely, thoughtfully decorated and had everything we needed. It had good heating, a strong shower, reliable WiFi - which you donât always get in European flats :) Location-wise, we really enjoyed being able to walk to Trastevereâs bars and restaurants in 5 minutes, then afterwards come home to a quiet area away from the crowds. Lavinia was generous with recommendations on what to do and where to go, and very responsive to our queries. Highly recommended."
50471,236442672,2018-02-19,9137020,Claire,"Perfect place to enjoy Rome! Walking distance from the main sites and from the Trastevere Station (train to the airport)
The flat is as cosy and sunny as it looks on the pictures, very comfortable and quiet
Lots of nice restaurant close (thumbs up to L'Orange, just a hundred metre from the flat)
Communication was smooth with Lavinia and her directions and tips were fully appreciated!"
50471,240581590,2018-03-05,34118438,Maribel,"El apartamento de Lavinia es un lugar perfecto para alojarse en Roma. Es acogedor, estÃ¡ bien ubicado y su anfitriona es fantÃ¡stica!!. VolverÃ­a siempre y por supuesto lo recomiendo siempre."
50471,242100356,2018-03-11,69759849,Orsolya,"We very appriciated this very charming, clean flat and the hospitalty of Lavinia. It is true that it is near to everything and looks exactly as it is in the photos. Still I have to leave a ""not very good"" comment only because of the noise. I am leaving in the center of a big city, so I am used to some noise, but unfortunately this flat is quite noisy because of traffic (cars, tram, etc.) and because of the fridge that I guess easily could be repaired."
50471,243230477,2018-03-15,171950786,Glenn,Nice loft on second floor in Italy but would be considered third floor in USA. It was comfortable and clean. We loved waking up there to bright terrace and kitchen with Nespresso machine. Our favorite morning spot was cafe Bernardino. I loved the area because it was close enough to centro Roma but then we could get away to cool Trastevere. Apartment was quiet. Nearby public transportation can get you anywhere.
50471,243765957,2018-03-17,19542458,Jamie,"Laviniaâs neighborhood of Trastevere is wonderful and my new favorite! Not too far from the must see touristic spots, but far enough to see a different side of Roma. Her place was the perfect size for all three of us, clean, with a beautiful terrace. Plenty of cafes and markets just steps away. We were able to check in early, and late because she graciously accommodated my mother who came down with the flu. Also told us exactly what to pick up from the Farmacia. Grazie Lavi!!!"

50471,255625280,2018-04-21,31083059,Katy,Lavi's apartment is perfect! Exactly as pictured and described. The outdoor space at the apartment is a really great perk! Check in was a breeze. Lavi gave great directions from the airport and local recommendations. I would highly recommend staying at Lavi's apartment if you get the chance!
50471,256946214,2018-04-24,30822110,Ellen,"Met mijn 22-jarige zoon heb ik 3 dagen genoten van de Romeinse cultuur en het overheerlijke eten.
Ons verblijf in het appartement van Lavinia maakte het feest compleet! Een perfect huisje, niet al te groot, maar volledig ingericht en van alle gemakken voorzien (heerlijke regendouche!). Na het wandelen door de stad was het heerlijk  bijkomen op het bloemrijke dakterrasje.
Lavinia voorziet je van veel informatie, restauranttips, bezienswaardigheden etc. We hebben haar niet persoonlijk ontmoet, maar de communicatie was heel prettig en zorgvuldig. Ik begrijp dat ze een 'superhost' is, welverdiend!
Zeker een adres om boven aan mijn lijstje te plaatsen voor het volgende Rome-bezoek! Ciao!"
50471,259122687,2018-04-30,179144522,Noa,"Loved the place 
Lavania is great and very helpful
Her apartment is in a very good location!"
50471,262225102,2018-05-08,51680803,Alec,"Just back from a perfect stay at Lavinia's apartment. If you like how it looks and reads on Airbnb then you will not be disappointed. Private, chic and in a smashing location - jump on the tram and within 15 mins you're in the hub of Rome. Head the other way to Trastevere Station and you're on the way to many out of city adventures. Could not be easier to get to and from Fiumicino Airport using public transport. Can't wait to stay again. Really wouldn't look at anywhere else!"
50471,263138366,2018-05-11,18609905,Jennifer,"Wonderful, spacious, clean and comfortable apartment! Good location, no noise, and Lavinia is a wonderful host!"
50471,263453668,2018-05-12,19385717,Josh,"Super chanting, cozy and bright flat! Terrific location in the heart of Trastevere, yet very private and quiet. Highly recommend if you want to escape the crazy crowds of Rome and stay in a more local neighborhood. Wish we had stayed more than one night!"
50471,265499237,2018-05-17,11541190,Rebecca,"Laviniaâs place was great for us! We enjoyed the outside terrace and the garden-like atmosphere. Lavinia was very thoughtful and provided us with many tips on local places to eat and visit. The bed was quite comfortable, and the tiny kitchen well equipped. We enjoyed the updated bathroom and all of the light that filtered into the apartment. THank you, Lavinia!"
50471,267687440,2018-05-22,21176739,Mettayya,"This apartment is so charming, clean, and comfortable that I didnât want to leave to explore. Amazing restaurants are just minutes away."
50471,268886029,2018-05-26,60942828,Sean,Lavina's apartment was lovely. It had a lot of natural light and an outdoor roof terrace. The location couldn't have been much better as it was a block off the 3 and 8 tram and walking distance into the heart of the Travestere neighborhood. The location was quiet but convenient. Lavina uses a self check in approach and allows you to drop bags off early. This was extremely helpful as we arrived on an earlt flight and were able to drop off luggage. Thanks Lavina.
50471,270182363,2018-05-28,108794013,Nora,"I attempted to make last minute arrangements to stay at Lavinia's home and when we messaged each other, she said it would not be a problem since she didn't have to meet me and that once I booked/paid, she could give me the code to enter the home. I ended up booking/paying for the room later in the evening and then I waited to see if I would receive an automated email with the code. I received nothing. I then tried to reach out to Lavinia to get the code and had no response. After multiple attempts to reach Lavinia, I told her to cancel my reservation and give me a full refund, since I didn't have access to the home and needed to make arrangements for that night, as it was already passed 7pm that evening. After about an hour, she did message back and apologized that she had been at the hospital with family and didn't have access to WIFI. I completely understood and had no issues with the reason on why she wasn't available. The part that concerned me was that AirBNB Support called me to ask me again the details on what happened and told me that they would have to decide if Lavinia was entitled to any of the funds, since the turnaround time of when I booked it online and when she reached out to me was only one hour. I explained that I had told her that I would be checking in that evening and felt that if she sent me an invite to book, I would have thought that she would have remained available for the evening. I don't know if it was Lavinia or AirBNB Support that was hesitant in refunding the full amount, but it was very stressful in trying to get my money back. I eventually did receive the full refund from her and am grateful, but it was a stressful experience. I did not stay at her house due to the check in issue and I'm sure this is an isolated event, but they shouldn't make it difficult to receive back funds for a stay that never happened, because the host was not available."
50471,272902213,2018-06-04,82910588,Melissa,"Lavi's place is absolutely perfect for a visit to Rome! Trastevere is the BEST and only neighborhood to stay in while visiting Rome if you want a more local experience. The location is perfect and walking distance to restaurants and attractions. The apartment itself was so cute, we spent a bit of time just hanging out in the lovely space. The apartment is ideal space for 2 people and if I return to Rome I would definitely stay here. Very good with communication on everything, and had great recommendations. Perfection!"
50471,273749598,2018-06-07,63034745,Helen,Our stay in Lavinia's apartment was wonderful. We found the location perfect and her tips of places to visit and eat were extremely useful
50471,274830806,2018-06-10,68751980,Kevin,"Lavinia was a great host. Very responsive. Be aware that the apartment is up several flights. If you have large luggage be prepared. Getting from train station to apartment, then up the stairs is not much fun with heavy luggage . But the beautiful/unique  terrace is worth the effort. On the edge of Trestevere. Go northwest into the neighborhood to get the true flavor of the neighborhood. "
50471,277305922,2018-06-16,11458856,Suzana,"Search no more. This is the perfect place to stay in Rome!

The apartment is as charming as you can see in the pictures and Lavinia is an amazing host. Fast response, great tips and to top it up she left us some nice amenities to brighten our stay :)

Trastevere is in my opinion the best neighbourhood to stay in Rome: very typical, great restaurants and away (but not so far) from the busy touristic city center. The apartment is very close to the trams and buses, so you can get from there to anywhere in Rome very easily.

Grazie mille for everything, Lavi!
hope we can stay there again if we ever go back to Rome :)"
50471,277992258,2018-06-17,195094208,Omaima,"Il loft di Lavinia Ã¨ bellissimo. Posto idilliaco, immerso nel verde, ottimo per rilassarsi ed evadere dalla routine cittadina. La terrazza perfetta per prendere il tÃ¨ pomeridiano con fondo sonoro degli uccelli. 
Il loft Ã¨ pulitissimo, molto luminoso e arredato con tanto amore.
Lavinia Ã¨ stata molto disponibile e gentile. Ci ritornerei molto volentieri."

50471,284213957,2018-07-01,59185566,Amy,"We loved staying here!! Rome was at the end of our 10 day Italy trip, and this apartment was a wonderful place to both relax and explore Rome. The neighborhood is quiet, and close to cool restaurants and two tram stops that will bring you right into the sites of the city.  The apartment itself is as pictured, and the terrace is gorgeous!! Definitely cozy, but perfect for two people. We would definitely stay here again!"
50471,286341748,2018-07-06,955066,Becca,Lavi was a great host and quick to respond to any questions.  The space is small but absolutely cozy and very quiet.  Would absolutely stay again!

The area is very quiet and just a few hundreds meters away from the more lively streets of Trastevere.  A great spot to spend a few days in Rome!"
50471,292609514,2018-07-18,57757292,Louisa,"It is a super cosy apartment in the centre of trastevere. Beautiful neighbourhood, all you need in walking distance. Inner city with all sites 20 to 30 min by foot or just take the tram.
Beautiful private terrace and Lavi had a lot of great tips for the whole city!
Thanks a lot, i would definitly come back!"
50471,293981322,2018-07-21,132746425,Lasse,The apartment is small but cozy and adequate for a big city stay. The location is a bit outside the interesting part of Trastevere but still within walking distance and the neighbourhood is quiet and optimal for retirement during the night. The terrace is a good add on for relaxing
50471,295784391,2018-07-24,192262809,Christine,"Cute place with authentic Italian flare. A lot of stairs, but neighbors were friendly and the lush gardens added great ambiance. "

Super bien desservi par les transport en commun. 
Dans Trastevere,le quartier parfait pour flÃ¢ner le soir et souper.
Moi et mon copain Ã©tions en voyage avec notre fils de 1 an et ce fut un sÃ©jour extra.
Merci!

50471,302042105,2018-08-05,70932084,Marco,"L'appartamento di Lavinia Ã© molto carino, silenzioso e in un edificio ben tenuto. La posizione Ã© buona e si trova in una zona tranquilla. Il letto Ã© comodo. La pulizia non Ã© il top, e in estate essendo l'appartamento all'ultimo piano e con tante vetrate si riscalda facilmente. Il check-in e il check-out sono automatizzati, quindi Ã© probabile che non incontrerete Lavinia, che comunque vi darÃ  tante indicazioni via messaggio."
50471,306182411,2018-08-12,170309819,Amelie,"Lâemplacement est trÃ¨s bien. Tout proche du tram 8 et 3 qui vous emmÃ¨nent vers les lieux touristiques.Un super marchÃ©, quelques restaurants et bar proches sans que la rue soit trop touristique.  Lâimmeuble et le studio sont trÃ¨s typiques et coquets. Lavinia est trÃ¨s rÃ©active et ses explications sont trÃ¨s prÃ©cises. "

50471,322056340,2018-09-12,45052073,Lauren,"Laviniaâs place was a perfect for our first visit to Rome. The space is just as described and the terrace is lovely place to relax.

The location was excellent as it has lots of bars and restaurants on your door step. I would recommend trying Lâ Orange a cute little place with great pasta and wine.
There is tram stop right near the apartment but if you like to walk most places it is a nice 30/40 minute walk to all of the main sites. There are a number of shops, supermarkets and pharmacies near by so all that you could need.

Thank you again for a lovely place to stay, we would totally recommend and will be in touch again when we visit Rome in the future :)"
50471,324536428,2018-09-17,25166428,Immanuel,"Spotless, stylish and cozy.  Great location for starting and ending walking tours of Rome!  Quiet neighborhood -- perfect for a relaxing. 

Lavinia is incredibly responsive -- we usually received responses within minutes of a query.  Her tips on what to see and do were spot on. 

Lovely host with a lovely home!"
50471,326041015,2018-09-21,23000880,Nick,This is a lovely bright clean flat in a quiet location in Travestere. It is compact but it's very comfortable and the terrace is a good size for two. Travestere centre is only 5 mins walk away or cross the Tiber and be in Testaccio in 15 mins or the Palatine in 20. Alternatively jump onto the regular trams (no3 and 8) at the stop 100 metres from the flat. Highly recommended if you want a quiet place well located as a springboard to the sights and different neighbourhoods of Rome.
50471,328152117,2018-09-25,6266568,Anita,"We had a great time in Rome, Laviniaâs apartment was the perfect place to stay: easy to get there from the airport, but still central, in an area full of nice local restaurants. The apartment is cosy and clean, and for us a nice terrace is always a plus."

50471,335160046,2018-10-11,2965034,ZoÃ©,"Lavinia'studio is quite charming and cozy, perfect for a couple: bright with its flowery terrace which is really a plus after having walked all day in Rome. The tram stop is 100m from the apartment, but we preferred to do everything on foot. We were never more than 45 minutes walk from what we wanted to visit.

Although we have never seen Lavinia, she was responsive to all our messages and we could see that the arrival and departure procedures are well established. Everything is planned and well described in the documents sent in advance. What we lose in human contact, we gain in a flawless organization, without loss of time or waiting. We will gladly come back to Lavinia on a future trip to this beautiful city."
50471,337433230,2018-10-16,7994935,Joslin,Lavinia was very responsive and accommodating and her place was cute and comfy! A great place to stay for Roman holiday.

Ses suggestions et recommandations sont aussi trÃ¨s pertinentes."
50471,349408829,2018-11-17,49019146,Sara,"We stayed for 6 nights in November in Lavinia's cosy  apartment. Lavinia is a very responsive host. Her suggestions for coffee/ restaurants  became my favourites Rumi and Cafe Trastavere! 
It was easy to respect the 'house rules' as all made sense to us. 
Access is easy into the centre by tram bus metro, but we walked everywhere through all the little streets of Trastavere, by the old Church of Maria and over the Ponte Sisto Bridge. Campo Di Fiori market by day and busy restaurants by night, on to all the wonderful sites of Rome.
Some days we spent more time in the apartment, relaxing. It was nice to be in a flat with books dvds. We needed the heating which was cosy. And extra bedding was available as the nights were chilly!
Kitchen was well equipped for simple meals with fridge and dishwasher too. We are foodies!
We found a yoga studio near by .
Could have spent more time there. Sorry to have to say goodbye."
50471,350992875,2018-11-21,37979103,NathanaÃ«l,"Such a lovely place in the heart of Trastevere! Lavinia's apartment is conveniently located in Rome: you can get to the historic centre of the city on foot or by public transit quite easily (although I would suggest to take the walk). It's also pretty easy to get there from the airport. Located on the third floor of nice building in a quiet street, the apartment itself is very cute and functional. There is everything you need to prepare your meals for a day full of adventures. Shout out to Lavinia for her tips and availability! She was very quick to answer my questions. I would definitely go back to this place, when hopefully, I return to Rome some day."
50471,352956735,2018-11-26,133348950,Markus,Our stay was amazing from opening the door to Lavinias place. The appartment is super cozy and we got everything we wanted and needed. Lavinia answered almost immidiately an always in the best way possible. Thats why I love airbnb.

Â¡Gracias por todo!"
50471,406035518,2019-01-28,16266791,Therese,"Lavinia's apartment is simply perfect. It's both light-filled and wonderfully quiet, two characteristics that are very hard to find in Rome. And the location can't be beat--easy walking distance to everything in Trastevere without being in the middle of the touristy area, and a nice longer walk (or public transport) to the Vatican or the heart of Rome. We hope to go back in warm weather so that we can take advantage of her lovely garden terrace. Thanks for everything, Lavinia!"
50471,413789101,2019-02-18,31149017,Jack,"The perfect apartment for a romantic break in Rome. Plenty of space for two and a really nice kitchen for making meals at home. Close to the bars and restaurants in Trastevere and Testaccio and easy walking distance to the main sights in the old town. 

We loved the market in Trastevere and the view over Piazza del Popolo. Weâd definitely stay here again."

The roof terrace was a lovely addition and I'm sure in Summer it would be perfect for coffee and drinks on the terrace.

A short walk from Trastevere, or a short tram ride from the city. Plenty of nightlife with 15 minutes walk. Close enough to the city , but far enough away to be quiet if  that's what your looking for."

It's truly beautiful and the plants spill out of the entryway of the building so you can easily recognize where ""home"" is.  Quite lovely to return to after a day walking the busy city streets!  It's a loft, so was a bit tight for a couple and two late-teenage boys, but the sliding door opens to a spacious flower-filled patio which helped to extend the space. Lavinia's place is cozy & bright, and SO clean - I've never seen tile that spotless. Kudos, Lavinia! :)"

The balcony and first floor garden are gorgeous. The only tough thing is the staircase which is very steep and dark but itâs worth it. I loved this place.

50471,470444678,2019-06-16,176111631,Lynn,"Our family of 3 had a lovely stay at Laviniaâs studio. The apartment was in a quieter area of Trastevere, but was conveniently located between two tram stops (trams 3 & 8) which made it super easy to get to and from the busier parts  of the area. Lavinia was quick and responsive before we arrived, check-in was easy- we appreciated her detailed directions and descriptions for checking in, as we arrived later at night. We also used her recommendations for a couple restaurants- spot on! My husband was very happy to have coffee in the apartment as well. We would easily stay here again- thank you Lavinia!"
50471,473275679,2019-06-21,248172659,Fran,"Laviniaâs place is a very comfortable and pretty little apartment with a fabulous terrace to sit out on a summer evening and enjoy the hum of Rome. The kitchen was well stocked, the Nespresso machine a bonus, and all the facilities worked well. The steps to the apartment are fairly narrow and steep to negotiate with a full sized suitcase, but manageable. Lavinia was very quick to respond to queries and helpful in arranging to leave my luggage prior to check in. I walked everywhere from the apartment. Its slightly further out of the city than some of Trastevereâs more touristy areas but still accessible, with plenty of bus and streetcar options very close by. 
I was very happy to have chosen to stay there and would definitely recommend it for 1-2 people."

50471,496409777,2019-07-27,11703757,Lauren,"We loved Lavinia's cozy apartment in Trastevere. It's close enough to the action that you can comfortably walk, but far enough away that you get a good night's sleep and avoid the street noise. She was thoughtful enough to provide milk, soy milk, nutella, tea, and coffee, and the little porch off the back made for a lovely spot to enjoy it in the morning. Thank you Lavina!"

Got many recommendations for places to go eat and see when I was there. I enjoyed my stay and would stay there again.
One thing to note is the shower. If you're at least an average sized guy the shower curtain can be a nuisance. I'm 6' 1"" and it was on top of me."

50471,547841648,2019-10-16,296817020,Jennifer,Here is a comfortable easy place to stay that also has a pleasant patio. It is in a residential neighborhood near transportation ... just need to be able to negotiate steps for a cosy hideout that has all the comforts of home and some creative enchantment..passing through small garden behind iron gate upon arrival. Lovely.

50471,606200165,2020-02-16,323030311,Ben,Great place to stay. Every into the building was difficult but also safe(3 locked doors). Easy access to shopping and grocery stores. Short ride on train or tram to tourist sights. If you have time after all the tourist sights go to some parks. Way less crowded but still very enjoyable especially if you go during the tourist season.
50471,609035351,2020-02-22,3742061,Gretchen,This was a sweet place with lots of personal touches. Great for people who want an authentic experience.

50471,642580166,2020-07-26,10072279,Alessandra,"We had the chance to stay at Lavinia's place for a long weekend and we simply loved it. The house is right behind Trastevere, which makes it the perfect starting point to easily explore one of the most suggesting areas in Rome. The terrace is welcoming and very well curated with the plants and everything, and the place per se has everything you may need, from dishwasher to hair drier to washing machine (that saved my life after days of roaming around Italy). Besides, it's very well curated in furnitures and everything, in perfect shabby style. She's very flexible and friendly. Highly recommended!"

The location is perfect for getting around with the Tram 3 and 8 right outside. Even though you are close to everything, the apartment is nice and quiet and the terrace is perfect for unwinding. I would recommend staying here to everyone."

Also close to the Metro.  If you do not speak Italian bring dvds as Rome does not have any English speaking stations.  I would rent this apartment again if I returned to Rome."
52805,215599,2011-04-03,317955,Brit,"Great Apartment.   We loved our stay.  Its a nice 25 minute walk to Colleseum.  We loved having the washer too!

52805,301681,2011-06-07,375646,Judy,"We arrived by train - called Francesco and he met us at the apartment.  It is beautiful, spacious and extremely clean.  Very modern decor.  Francesco was helpful with maps and info for getting around Rome.  Everything worked: A/C (so nice to have), washer (needed desperately clean clothes, coffee maker and microwave.  I would highly recommend this rental space for anyone visiting Rome.  Thank you again Francesco!  Ciao!"

52805,461828,2011-08-21,337424,Monica,"Our family of five has just returned from this lovely apartment in Rome.  The apartment is very modern, spacious and tastefully decorated.  The kitchen is extremely well equipped and there is a washing machine as well.  We were within a 20 minute walk to the Colosseum and Forums and within walking distance of many other sights and restaurants.  Francesco was extremely responsive during our initial contact with him.  He made himself very accessible to us both when we arrived in Rome and the night before we flew out, making the check-in/check out process extremely easy.  We will recommend this apartment to anyone we know visiting Rome."
52805,536287,2011-09-16,951347,Family,The apartment was very nice.  It was clean and well equipped.  It served our needs for our stay in Rome.  Francesco was very helpful.  We would definitely consider staying there again and would recommend the place.  
52805,553005,2011-09-21,357813,Arkadiusz,"We stayed in Francesco's apartment in Rome in September 2011.  We were looking for a nice place to stay in Rome for 5 days and we must say we found the perfect one.  The apartment is very clean with nice modern furniture, with fully equiped kitchen (including an iron and a hairdryer in a bathroom) in a quiet building. It has two bedrooms with AC and two full bathrooms. The  livingroom is very spacious with AC and TV. The apartment  is located in a walking distance to a metro station as well as other major sites, such as Collsseum,  Roman Forum, San Giovanni in Laterano etc.  We are very happy that we chose this place out of thousands others in Rome and we would recommend wthout any hesitation Francesco's apartment to everyone who is looking for a comfortable place to stay in Rome.   "
52805,617801,2011-10-11,525211,Luz,"Fantastic property. Spacious, clean, tidy and a joy to relax in after experiencing the sites of Rome. Convenient to all services. You must try the hot chocolate just around the corner at Cafe Italia.  Will stay here again when next in Rome. Plenty of room for family of 5 or 6 or two couples."
52805,667821,2011-10-27,22007,Kenneth & Carolyn,"We were very pleased with the Apt. it was very nice and well located, the beds were very comfortable and kitchen  had everything needed.  It was very clean, it had a large flat screen tv and cd player, but if you want something in English you had better bring it with you.
The only draw backs were not all costs were up front on Airbnbs website (high season, city taxs added 20% to the costs) but it still was a great bargain, and the front bedroom was somewhat noisy being next to the front door and elevator, just bring some earplugs.
It is also somewhat hard to find being inside a private gate.
We would  highly recommend this property.

52805,677333,2011-11-01,179256,Denise,"This apartment was great, definitely exceeded our expectations. Very clean and modern. There were 2 separate bedrooms, and two bathrooms, plus a living area with a sofa that could be converted into a bed if necessary. Francesco was very helpful, allowing us to check in a bit early (since our flights arrived into Rome in the morning), and he gave us a lot of good information about the neighborhood and transportation options. This apartment is not in the center of tourist activity, but we actually preferred it this way. Lots of little groceries and restaurants, and not too far from the tram, metro and bus stops. We loved this place and would recommend it to anyone visiting Rome. "
52805,745734,2011-11-27,954935,Joyce,"My mother-in-law, daughter and I stayed at Francesco's beautiful apartment for a week in November, 2011.  We loved the apartment, the location, the neighborhood and Francesco was extremely kind and helpful.  There are places that advertise free WiFi that provide limited or poor quality WiFi--not Francesco!  We had no problems with internet connections with any of our multiple American devices.  It was a short 5 minute walk in either direction to a bus stop, a longer but enjoyable walk to the metro and a 10 minute bus ride to the train station.  There are plenty of places in the immediate neighborhood to eat, and butcher shops and produce stands practically outside the door if you prefer to eat in.  If I am ever fortunate enough to return to Rome I will definitely want to stay here again!"
52805,766798,2011-12-06,893096,Julie,"My friend and I stayed here in December 2011. The apartment was very nice and clean. It was well located for the Metro, and it was easy to walk to some of the main sights. Francesco made it easy to check in and check out.I forgot to call him when I arrived at the airport but he rushed over as soon as I contacted him. He gave us a map and some recommendations for local restaurants. He also called us a cab when we checked out. I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Rome. I would definitely stay there again. Thanks Francesco!"

Our host advised us of the easiest way from the train station, met us at the apartment on arrival and called us a taxi to the airport for our departure. Note the â¬200 refundable deposit mentioned in the listing, required in cash at arrival. 

We'd certainly keep Francesco's apartment in mind if we return to Rome."

Tram and metro just five minutes away, taking you straight to the main train station, to begin exploring this great city.
Locally we found a great restuarant with very good prices.
Wifi worked everytime

Francesco was at the end of the phone and was great.  "
52805,1349528,2012-05-26,134802,Claudiu,"PERFECT place, very large (we were 3 people and had plenty of space), nice furnishings, kitchen equipped with all necessities (we like to cook quick meals in the a.m. so we save some $ - we found everything that we needed), metro/subway within a 10 min SLOW walk. Place is also quiet - it very quickly felt like home. Also, cabs from virtually all touristic attractions back to Francesco's place were extremely reasonable - 10-15 euros max including a tip! On every day we would walk to the subway in the a.m., but come back home in the evening by cab - it was the perfect combo for us. Francesco is also a very nice person, communication was perfect, he was able to get us a cab to the airport, give directions etc - we would definitely come back next time we're in Roma. BTW, don't believe all the stories about the cab drivers in Italy - we only had pleasant experiences with them :)"
52805,1388348,2012-05-31,1144277,Jillian,"Francesco's apartment was perfect for our family of 4. Really nice, interesting location that's only a 20 minute walk from center city. there is also a really convenient bus that's right around the corner that you can take to all of the attractions in Rome. The apartment itself was clean, spacious and Francesco could not have been more accommodating and communicative. Great experience! I highly recommend this apartment."
52805,1477793,2012-06-14,1578716,Michele,Great location! Beds were very comfortable and the apartment was clean and nicely furnished.  Francesco is a wonderful host and very helpful.

52805,1581310,2012-06-28,1725607,Andrea,Francesco is an excellent host. His apartment is very nice and perfect for relaxation. It is comfortable for our family of 5 and fully equipped. It also has a nice decoration and most importantly it was very clean. We regret having stayed only two nights. Francesco gave us really helpful tips on where to eat and what to visit in Rome. Overall it was a really good experience. We would definitely stay there again.Â 
52805,1758971,2012-07-21,1876220,Eugene,"Francesco's apartment is the perfect apartment for your stay in Rome! located just a short walk from the coliseum and across the street from an aquaduct, it is both spacious and incredibly well designed.

52805,2036134,2012-08-20,1372312,Rosalyn,we loved staying at Francesco's apartment.  It was very clean and well appointed  - everything we needed and more.  We felt safe in the area and transport links into all the major attractions were fast and easy.  Especially liked Francesco's recommendation for an amazing ice cream parlour close by - fully of history and great gelato!  Thanks for everything Francesco.

Francesco fue muy amable, nos sentimos como en casa, si volvieramos a roma no dudariamos en ir a lo de Francesco.

Francesco was prompt and business-like in his transactions with us - and very warm and helpful.
Five stars on all counts - would definitely return here on our next trip to Rome and recommend it to others."

52805,3305486,2013-01-07,2686193,Nichelle,"First of all the actual apartment is BETTER than the description.  It is so big!  And the interior design is fabulous.  There are big beautiful windows in every room so the place is very light and airy.  The bathrooms are very chic!  The kitchen is big and inviting.  My Mom and I spent a nice amount of time over tea in the Kitchen.  You have a dining set in the kitchen and a formal one in the living room!  (FAB!)  We ate out in Rome but sometimes we cooked and the kitche has a beautiful convection oven and is equiped with everything we needed.   The layout of the apartment was perfect for me and my Mom.  We each had our own rooms and bathrooms and because the place is so big the rooms are a nice distance apart to allow for maximum privacy.  But this apartment could easily accomodate more people and still not compromise privacy or spaciousness.  The location was perfect.  There was a Trattoria, Osteria, grocery store, convenience store, Pizzaria, pasticceria, historic monuments, bus transportation all within a two block radius, and we were only a short walk from the Metro.  And I loved it all!  I'd recommend this place for sure!"
52805,3336595,2013-01-13,3687391,Catherine,"Francesco's apartment is exactly as described - it is incredibly spacious (more than enough room for four people), very clean and with everything we needed to make our stay in Rome really enjoyable. Francesco is a great host, he was always prompt to reply to all of our emails when we were arranging our stay, he was there to meet us when we arrived and gave us recommendations and information about the local area and getting around Rome. Apart from several supermarkets close by, there is also a little deli right next door, and a fresh produce stall on the corner. If you like ice cream, make sure you go to G.Fassi's ice cream palace which is a 10-15 minute walk away, the most amazing gelateria we've ever been to! When we checked out, Francesco called a taxi for us which we really appreciated. We would definitely recommend Francesco's elegant apartment and next time we are in Rome, we really hope we can stay there again. Thanks Francesco!"

The apartment was much bigger than I expected and very large by European standards.  We had 2 large bedrooms, one with its own private bathroom, a renovated kitchen, and a large living room.  Francesco was very helpful every time I contacted him and he was very prompt at check-in.  The location is about a 5 minute walk from the Manzoni metro-stop, which makes it very accessible to everything.   It was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend staying at this location.  "
52805,3613232,2013-02-26,1390523,David,"We have rented apartments all over Europe, and  found this to be the best we have stayed in. The apartment was very clean, large, with 2 bedrooms and a third room that has a sofa bed that turns into a third bedroom and 2 baths. Francesco was very friendly and accommodating. The apartment was large enough for us 5 adults to have our own privacy and within 5 minutes of the underground. "
52805,3682079,2013-03-04,270435,Delphine,"Francesco est quelqu'un de trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et prÃ©venant. Il nous a accueillir avec le sourire malgrÃ© notre gros gros retard Ã  l'arrivÃ©e! La propretÃ© de l'appartement est impeccable et il est situÃ© dans un quartier sympatique, bien qu'un peu excentrÃ© du coeur historique de Rome. Nous Ã©tions Ã  10 Ã  peine Ã  pied de la plus proche station de mÃ©tro et mettions entre 20 et 30 min Ã  descendre au ColisÃ©e Ã  pied (avec une poussette!). CommerÃ§ants vraiment trÃ¨s trÃ¨s agrÃ©able dans le quartier. La boulangerie de l'autre cÃ´tÃ© de la rue et le restaurant La Sol Fa ont nos prÃ©fÃ©rences! On s'est rÃ©galÃ© chez eux!
Le point nÃ©gatif pour nous est la non-luminositÃ© de l'appartement, situÃ© au premier Ã©tage d'un grand immeuble. Des barreaux sont aux fenÃªtres mais on peut les ouvrir avec des clÃ©s. On s'est parfois senti un peu Ã©touffer Ã  l'intÃ©rieur. L'appartement est trÃ¨s mal isolÃ©, nous entendions vraiment les bruits de la cage d'escaliers et de l'appartement du dessus. Ce qui a parfois fait peur au fils de mon amoureux, de presque 4 ans. Sinon, l'appartement est trÃ¨s spacieux et on avait vraiment de l'espace."
52805,3855150,2013-03-21,77712,M,"We loved this apartment. It is veeerrry spacious.  Though it is not located in the center of Rome it is a 7 minute walk to the metro (Manzoni) trams and busses.  Francesco was very attentive to us from the moment of our booking. We would definitely stay here again.

We stayed with a baby and Francesco kindly provided us a crib."
52805,3888382,2013-03-25,737812,Ruji Charliz,We're super happy with our stay here. Location is not too bad. close enough to the metro. Francesco was very helpful with everything! He gave us suggestions on places we should visit and what not. He was also kind enough to help us call a taxi cab for our departure. The apartment was very large. I'd recommend this place! two thumbs up.
52805,3994850,2013-04-02,4494216,Chung-Yueh,Clean and modern decoration apartment in a quiet area. Convenience traffic by public transportation.
52805,4040028,2013-04-05,4362637,Carolyn,"Francesco's apartment in Rome is fantastic! It's really well equipped, nicely decorated and really spacious. There is a deli, butchers, supermarket and bakery nearby and a few restaurants too! Although it's not supremely located for 'nightlife', it's only a five minute walk from the tube station and there are tram stops too; it was nice to come back to a quiet apartment in the evening. Francesco's apartment is also great value- we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. For anybody wondering whether Air BnB is a good idea, we found the whole process really easy, problem free and such good value in what is renowned as a really expensive city! "
52805,4074454,2013-04-08,4097106,Marie,"Superbe expÃ©rience Romaine. Accueil parfait de Francesco malgrÃ© notre arrivÃ©e tardive; celui ci a pris le temps de nous noter sur le plan de Rome les endroits qu'on lui indiquÃ©s et de rÃ©pondre Ã  toutes nos questions.
Nous avons pu profiter de quelques bonnes adresses de cafÃ© et de restaurants.
La petite attention du lait et du pain pour le petit dej du lendemain nous a ravies mes amies et moi. 
En ce qui concerne l'appart il est superbe, trÃ¨s clair trÃ¨s calme.
Mille mercis Ã  Francesco. une adresse Ã  retenir et qui donne envie de revenir dans la citÃ© Ã©ternelle.

52805,4373558,2013-05-01,3284825,Pawan,"Stayed here for 2 nights about a week ago. Francesco's apartment was beautiful! The pictures do not do it justice. Extremely clean, safe and lots of windows for sun. Check-in was super easy, and all the amenities were provided. We walked everywhere in Rome from this apartment, and got some good tips from Francesco. I would stay here again without a doubt! "

Il est bien localisÃ©, Ã  dix minutes Ã  peine du mÃ©tro Manzini. Il y a des marchands de fruits et lÃ©gumes juste au coin de la rue et une Ã©picerie et un bon restaurant tout prÃ¨s.

52805,4657788,2013-05-19,4062321,Bev,"We spent 4 nights in Francesco's apartment. Everything was great and he was very helpful. Neighborhood is safe, and markets and restaurants close by. Plenty of room, light and fresh air. Park nearby. We stayed in 3 rentals during our recent trip, and Francesco was the only one who showed up with eggs, bread and milk, plus a bottle of wine. What a great welcome. We would return here, if we are so lucky to visit Rome again."

We had a marvellous time in Rome!
Public transport is nearby as well as supermarkets and restaurants."
52805,4960596,2013-06-04,4837913,Robinn,"My husband, myself and another couple stayed at Francesco's flat last weekend.  It was spotlessly clean, fresh towel and linens and very nicely decorated.  We had been traveling for weeks and were so excited to find hot water in the flat! The beds were comfy and the kitchen had everything we needed to feel very comfortable.  Francesco even left us some pastries.  

The main thing that impressed us, though, was Francesco.  He was very helpful and kind.  My husband was ill during our stay and Francesco was very concerned and helped us several times during our short stay.  

This is a great flat for a long stay, it is in a great little neighborhood that lets you feel like a ""local"".  Several great restaurants and shops nearby.  It is about a 20-25 minute walk to the Coliseum area.  You'll enjoy this spacious flat if you are lucky enough to get a reservation.  We'll definitely stay here again when in Rome.

Thanks again Francesco for all your help and concern!"
52805,5111217,2013-06-13,5054221,Jenni,"We had a wonderful time in Rome.  Francesco was a very pleasant and friendly host.  His apartment was large and spotless.   The location was perfect as It was very close to all transport, train, tram and buses.  We would definitely stay again."
52805,5203425,2013-06-18,1553536,Keith,"We stayed at Francesco's apartment in Rome from June 13-17, 2013 ( My wife and 2 teenage daughters)  We arrived late to the apartment because of traffic and paid a 30 euro penalty which we knew upfront would be charged.  The apartment was very nice and in a very good location in Rome.   There is are good stores and shops nearby.   The Metro is a short walk away and we used this to travel to a lot of the key tourist spots in Rome.  Apartment was great, great kitchen, bathrooms, bedrooms and air conditioning.   Wifi was spotty at times.     If you want a very nice apartment in a great location in Rome this is a very nice apartment.  I would stay hear again without hesitation. "
52805,5271857,2013-06-22,4624675,Bo,"We had a fantastic several days at Francesco's apartment. It was always such a relief to come back from a day of sight seeing to a nice, cool, quiet apartment to relax for a few hours before heading out to dinner. He was a very gracious host and provided us with some good info upon our arrival. The map he gave us was as good if not better than any of those we brought along. Very helpful for navigating Rome. As others have mentioned the Metro is about a 10 min walk which is very manageable. I would however recommend learning the bus system as soon as you get there as the bus stops just around the corner and can save you a some walking time if you are making multiple trips into the city center per day. Wish we had figured out the bus system sooner in our stay. All in all, a great stay!"
52805,5337489,2013-06-25,4592615,Botha,"Francesco's place is more than just an apartment, its almost a house! Located in a safe area that is about 10min walk to nearest metro train station. He was extremely accommodating with our check-in time and responsive to communication. Francesco went out of his way to buy some basic groceries for the kitchen which was unexpected and appreciated. He gave us a complementary map of Rome and indicated all the major attractions. All-in-all a wonderful stay and highly recommended!"
52805,5446060,2013-07-01,4547519,Chris,"We are just back from a marvellous time in Rome- the apartment was the best we have ever stayed in, everything was new and spotlessly clean. Francesco was a fantastic host, he turned up with bread and milk and a map of Rome and he gave us advice on where to go to find a supermarket and all of the sights. The apartment is large- plenty of room for 5 people- and freshly decorated. The wifi works well but it can be a bit slow in the evenings.   Overall we would highly recommend this apartment and would love to return to stay there one day. 
"
52805,5539351,2013-07-05,5695770,Monica,"Francesco was a great host and the apartment was large and very comfortable. We did not speak Italian, but we communicated great in Spanish and English. He was waiting for us at the entrance, had some breakfast for us for the following morning, a map and some suggestions of where to go, etc. Wifi was sporadic. Other than that everything was great. There is even a washer that was helpful for us.. And Francesco arranged for us to be picked up the last day to go to the Airport. The service was excellent as we had somewhat of a Tour along the way."
52805,5653991,2013-07-10,1761966,James,"Spacious apartment with modern furnishings located in quiet residential area of Rome. Larger than our apartment in Austin, TX. Nice to relax in the living room and appreciated the airco in the living area and bedrooms. We loved the neighborhood and its restaurants, coffee shop and markets. Nice to escape the noisy and touristy areas and feel like a local. Francesco is a wonderful host. Met us at our arrival with juice and breakfast items for our first morning, then reviewed how to navigate Rome. Subway stop within easy walking distance provided the most reliable connections into Rome, unless you are headed to the Colossium then take the tram. Highly recommended."

Will definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking to stay in Rome in a very nice area in this beautiful apartment. Will definitely stay there again, "
52805,5960645,2013-07-24,3534595,Jeanine,"This s a fantastic place to stay.  Francesco met us at the apartment and we appreciated that he left us juice, milk and breakfast items for the next day.  As a family of five we loved having such a spacious apartment that was so clean and comfortable.  It's not far from the station and is close to restaurants, supermarket where we bought antipasto for dinner one night and most importantly within walking distance to Fassi for the  best gelato in Italy. You can have dinner, then gelato and then buy what you need at the supermarket on your way home, all in one area. You won't get better accommodation at such a great price. Highly recommend."
52805,6099396,2013-07-30,390217,Tarryn,"This was a fantastic apartment and we had a brilliant five days in Rome staying here. Proximity to the metro is perfect, only 6 minutes walk, and it is very quick to get into the centre of Rome on the metro. Not to mention a 20 minute walk to the Colosseum, very convenient! The neighbourhood is great with some lovely supermarkets, butchers and fruit stalls nearby and the restaurant (Osteria) over the road must be visited, delicious, authentic food and great service. Francesco met me at the apartment and brought us wine, fresh juice and milk, and some baked goods, really lovely. He was incredibly helpful and friendly and showed us where to go out and eat in the evenings, which was really helpful. He also helped us book a taxi to the wedding we were going to, so he was an absolute superstar. I'd highly recommend staying here - everything about the place is perfect and I'll definitely stay here on my next visit to Rome! Thanks for everything Francesco!"
52805,6234363,2013-08-05,4659483,Emily,We has a fabulous stay at the apartment. Francesco was very hospitable. They even left us a few things for breakfast which was a lovely touch. The apartment was fully air conditioned so it was very comfortable when it was steamy outside! Everything you could have neded was there... From towels to washing powder!

52805,6609781,2013-08-19,5270248,Carlos,"Todo perfecto. Francesco nos enviÃ³ un chofer al aeropuerto y, cuando llegamos al apartamento nos estaba esperando con algo para el desayuno del dÃ­a siguiente. Estuvo un rato explicÃ¡ndonos lo que habÃ­a que saber de la casa y de los sitios de alrededor (supermercado,nbares, paradas de metrony autobÃºs que nos marcÃ³ en un plano que tenÃ­a preparado.

La casa limpia, todo en perfecto estado, el aire acondicionado bien. El Ãºnico pequeÃ±o inconveniente es que la cama de matrimonio es un poco blanda a mi modo de ver. TambiÃ©n coemntar que el sofÃ¡ cama del salÃ³n tiene una madera en el medio  por lo que sÃ³lo es vÃ¡lido para dos niÃ±os pequeÃ±os o uno si es mayor. Los nuestros, de 11 y 9 (el de 11 es grande)) protestaron pero durmieron sin problemas. Para dos adultos o, incluso ara uno, no lo aconsejo, sobre todo si ya se tienen unos aÃ±itos...

Salvo estos dos detalles, todo muy bien. Claro que la casa podrÃ­a haber estado algo mÃ¡s cÃ©ntrica, pero la relaciÃ³n precio calidad de esta es inmejorable y hay transporte cercano que re lleva a cualquier sitio."
52805,8582004,2013-11-06,7117923,Anita,"Very nice host and apartment. Our flight arrived early that morning, so after giving him a call, he arrived in a few minutes and was very nice to accomodate us even if the previous guests were just about to leave. We left our luggages and was able to go around that same day.  It was very nice of him to leave us some goodies (Milk, juice and cookies).  The apartment is close to train station.  The only place we have to take the train was to Vatican otherwise we were able to walk to almost every tourist place.  Fruit stand, deli as well as restaurant nearby.  We had problem with hot water one night and I e-mailed Francesco and problem was fixed immediately.  I would recommend this place to anybody who wants a nice place and we will not hesitate to go back again ."
52805,8737972,2013-11-15,5671304,Adriana,"Es un excelente apartamento para pasar vacaciones en Roma. Tiene cerca la estaciÃ³n del metro, la estaciÃ³n del tren y una plaza donde se pueden tomar taxis, en caso de ser necesario. Al rededor se pueden encontrar pizzerias, mercados, farmacia  y cafeterÃ­as. El apartamento es muy cÃ³modo y todo estÃ¡ como nuevo. El Edificio es tranquilo. El anfitriÃ³n fue muy amable con nosotros. Nos dio informaciÃ³n de la ciudad y algunos consejos prÃ¡cticos para nuestra estadÃ­a. AdemÃ¡s estuvo pendiente de nosotros. Definitivamente lo recomiendo para cualquier viajero en Roma. "

52805,9280653,2013-12-18,1707808,Carmen,"We stayed in this apartment for 4 nights over December. Really enjoyed our stay here, beautiful big apartment with everything in the kitchen you would need. Francesco met us at the apartment with some juice and breakfast cake and some bread fr the first morning. In a nice quite apartment block and walking distance t the Colosseum. 

The host also made some recommendations as to where a great Sunday market was. Fresh vegetables sold outside of apartment, with convenient store close by and a pharmacy. 

Only negative is the second shower is quite small, and the metro station is a bit of a walk, especially if your doing it with luggage. But other than that it was a perfect stay and would definitely recommend staying in this apartment!
"
52805,9731736,2014-01-07,5207519,ÐÐ°ÑÐ°Ð»ÑÑ,"We five together stopped in this apartment for 9 days from December 28 to January 6, reserved it in May. Warm and very pure apartment. Central heating according to the schedule from 6 o'clock p.m. till 6 o'clock a.m. and in addition there are conditioners.
The apartment rather convenient for such number of guests.  Beds in bedrooms very convenient and quite soft, the sofa in a drawing room also is a berth, but more rigid, it is possible to choose for every taste.  Everything is very pure. 
In the apartment there is all stock necessary for cooking.
The owner is very attentive to guests and is kind - helped to organize to us a transfer from the airport, when settling to the apartment all told and showed as well as than to use, presented to us a Rome map and showed on it once again an arrangement of the apartment and all stops.  When settling the owner treated us - offered sweets, milk and a traditional Christmas fruitcake. 
Arrangement of the apartment conveniently - near the subway and stops of other transport. The house of thorough construction with a quiet court and friendly neighbors. The court yard is closed on the lock. Near the house two minimarkets and a meat little shop, a flower bench settle down.
I recommend all this apartment!"

There's a couple great little cafes at the end of the street, one for cakes and coffee, the other for all sorts of Italian cooked food. You can even buy pizza by weight! We had a great week, the area is good for local transport but we chose to walk everywhere. It only took 30mins to walk to the Colosseum. As others have said, Francesco is a thoughtful host, everything you need is in the apartment. His communication was excellent and we felt very welcome. I would certainly recommend this apartment to my friends. Thank you Francesco."

Francesco war ein netter Gastgeber. Er empfing uns mit GetrÃ¤nken (Cola, Bier, Saft, Milch ) und Brot fÃ¼r das FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck am nÃ¤chsten Morgen.
Die Wohnung liegt sehr ruhig (SchlafrÃ¤ume zum Innenhof) und ist wirklich empfehlenswert. Ãffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind schnell erreichbar (nur wenige Minuten zu FuÃ), alles in allem eine sehr gute Unterkunft fÃ¼r einen Urlaub in Rom.
Vielen Dank an Francesco! Tanti saluti!"
52805,13235107,2014-05-23,7774143,Nancy,Francesco is the ultimate host.  He was prompt returning calls and providing any information we needed to assure our trip was totally enjoyable.

We really enjoyed his house. Every things were what he said and what photos showed. Spacey and fancy master bedroom and living room were great and water heater, A/C worked fine.

You can find everything you need there.

My kids especially loved Nutella cups to use. Enough plates, cups for us.
House was secured and clean.
I really recommend this place for bigger group or family. Thanks, Francesco. . I wish I can stay your place again.

It really could not have been better!"
52805,15618645,2014-07-13,11441708,Michael,"Francesco and his apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The apartment was very clean and extremely spacious.  The location was fantastic with lovely restaurants and a fresh fruit stand nearby.  The Colosseum is a 20 minute walk with a metro stop only a few blocks away.  

Francesco went above and beyond by meeting us the first day with a map of Rome and personal recommendations marked on the map.  He made sure we had everything we needed and checked in on us mid-week to ensure everything was to our satisfaction.

We would definitely recommend this deal to friends and family.  

Thank you so much, Francisco for being such a wonderful host and accommodating our unexpected early arrival.  We had a wonderful time. "
52805,15860903,2014-07-17,6010044,Peter,"We weren't able to meet Francesco, as he was busy at the time, but we met his friend Marco. The apartment was very big and beautiful, with modern furniture. Marco was also very friendly, and picked us up at the station when we got lost. He also showed us on a map where all the useful points are, and even took us to the tram station so we could find it easily. It was also very secure, and in a nice convenient neighborhood. They also bought some small snacks and drinks for us when we arrived. It was a great place, and we would love to visit again sometime!"

52805,17610796,2014-08-15,5556004,Brigitta,My stay at this flat was perfect. The flat is huge for Europe and with four of us staying in the space we never felt like we did not have enough room. The furnishings are simple and welcoming. You will feel like you have a second home in Rome. There are bus stops right around the corner and the Manzoni metro stop is about a 10 min walk away to take to to all the essential parts of Rome.  There is a great courtyard outside the buildings as well as a park next to an ancient aqueduct. There is a grocery store right down the street for supplies should you need. The flat also had ample air conditioning which was a blessing during the hot month of August. Lastly i must mention Francesco. What a wonderful inviting host. He provided a quick explanation of the apartment as well as directions and recommendations for where to eat nearby and the quickest ways to get around. He also provided breakfast for the week as a welcome gift. I felt like i could call him with questions at any time though i didn't need to. I strongly provide my recommendation for this wonderful flat and the hospitality of Francesco. 
52805,19021454,2014-09-05,12511090,Brandon,Francesco was a fabolous host and welcomed us into his wonderful home. His apartment is very spacious and in a very safe neighborhood with a gated entrance. He showed us where to eat and catch the metro and provided very good communication to us while we were there. His flat is located close to a metro which will take you to all the famous sites within Rome. Highly recommend!

We used the Tram - #3 and is a 5 min walk away.  Several local restaurants 3 mins walk. Photos of apartment are as advertised, very clean and wonderful comfortable beds and pillows! No complaints at all with our stay. Apartment is roomy, the master bedroom with ensuite is the smaller of the two rooms. Massive second bedroom with separate bathroom. Separate kitchen and lounge area. One floor up, in a gated complex so no worries with security. Wouldn't hesitate to come back when we travel to Rome again. Thanks Franceso you were a pleasure to deal with! "

Francesco was very kind introducing us the apartment and interesting locations in Rome. As we like walking it was not a problem that the location is slightly out of the central area of Rome, and public transport possibilities are also nearby if required. The listing is very accurate and we would certainly recommend this apartment to everyone staying in Rome!"
52805,47267662,2015-09-17,37292252,Marion,Same as the pic good for thefamily though a you need to walk a while to go to the station. Overall very good!

We had a very nice time in Rome and in this apartment."

El trato con el propietario fue correcto, aunque nos obligÃ³ a abandonar la casa a las 10:00, con el argumento de que los siguientes inquilinos llegaban a esa hora. Algo bastante raro, si se tiene en cuenta que las normas de la casa, publicadas en su pÃ¡gina, informan de que la hora de entrada es las 16:00. Recomiendo concretar este detalle antes de reservar, en caso de que se necesiten dejar las maletas."

He answered all of our questions with patience. We were 6 people and all had enough space in the flat, and it was a good location near buses and metro to get around. We felt very safe in the neighborhood. If you come to Rome we would highly recommend staying here!"

The flat is as seen in the pictures and really is very clean and confortable and with everything you could possibly need.  There is access to public transport  but we tended to walk into central Rome and get a taxi back in the evenings- around 15 euros.  I would definitely recommend to others will  book again!"

52805,153226557,2017-05-20,127757335,Myra,"Francesco is a refined gentleman who met us promptly as agreed. His home is clean and pleasant and decorated in minimalist modern style. A big plus here is that there are three different sleeping areas and two bathrooms, one off the master bedroom. The room with the (comfortable double) hideabed has a window onto a street from which there was street noise but the other two were pretty quiet (except one night during a thunderstorm when car alarms kept going off with each thunder strike). Upon arrival Francesco kindly offered a great deal of information about how to get to attractions from his home but we were very jetlagged at the time. It was too much info to absorb. For other guests I would suggest leaving a simple information card posted somewhere mentioning things like for example: Subway line A is your first left upon exiting. Small grocery store is on main street, fruit market hours are 10-3, etc etc...whatever, because although Francesco did a fine job of delivering these bits of information, it went in one ear and out the other. Travel time is precious and it would be a great service to recognize people arrive tired and on different time zones. Quick-access information like that is precious. We kept missing the little fresh produce market around the corner for that reason. We didn't know the hours. The home is a few subway stops from main attractions in a very comfortable and picturesque residential area. We felt very safe. Main drawback was that it was not easy/close walking distance to main attractions, though it is very easy access by subway and bus, so ideal for those who want a bit of distance from the action. Good kitchen for putting light meals together - much appreciated- and a little grocery store (bring your Italian phrase book: they speak no English!) around the corner."
52805,155097979,2017-05-27,30784176,Alexandra,"Great place. Close to the Colosseum and to the metro station. Safe, fully equipped with all the appliances you may need.    "
52805,156649514,2017-05-31,126285102,Haben,"I had a great stay at Francesco's apartment with my family. Francesco has a very nice place at a good location. There is a supermarket around the corner and another one within 5 min walking. Public transport is perfect with the trams 5 and 14 and buses. There are restaurants in the area, a butcher, a fish shop etc. Simply everything you need.

Francesco prepared everything very good (towels, extra keys for the apartment, WiFi code etc) and that was very satisfying. The check-in with a friend of Francesco went very smooth. Compliment to the both of them because his friend really took the time to explain everything in detail. Francesco is really a great host with a clean and charming apartment! "

Communication was excellent and check in was very detailed and easy. The apartment was very clean and spacious for our family of five. It was fully stocked and very well located. We particularly enjoyed the local shops, restaurants and easy access to public transport. Small markets, produce stands,  bakeryâs, gelateriaâs, restaurants all within 2 min or less walk, made life easy. All the main attractions are 20-40 min walk depending where you go and much faster if taking public transit. We felt safe there and the locals are very kind.

52805,529209914,2019-09-14,42637469,Wes,"I didn't meet Francesco personally, his friend let us in and showed us around. The apartment is pretty true to what you see in the photos, very clean and spacious! If you plan to cook the kitchen has some essentials like oil, instant coffee, sugar, etc. No paper towels or enough toilet paper for the bathroom for four people. 

Location is not ideal if you don't plan to walk a lot or take the metro. I was traveling with my girlfriend and she elderly parents so walking was hard for them. We had to pay for taxi's or uber but both are pretty expensive and hard to come by. However if you do plan to take the metro, the station is close by as well as Termini- about a 10min walk. We were even able to walk to the Colosseum which was roughly 20 mins.

There is a small set of stairs that leads to the apartment door, but it's very manageable. All in all a great apartment, nothing outstanding, but still a great apartment that comfortably fits four or more."

The area isn't touristy, so the restaurants have great food at very reasonable prices.

The appt is nice and modern, beds comfortable.

We were very happy to have stayed here and would again.

The location gives you a view of Rome outside of the tourist areas.  Stores, cafes, pharmacy all within a few minutes walk.  Gabriele was very helpful taking care of all our our questions and needs!!  I would recommend to anyone coming to Rome that wants to experience the real Rome!!  "

53203,7332397,2013-09-16,7931240,Andrew,"This was a very nice apartment. It catered for all our needs during our stay in Rome. It is just a pity we couldn't stay for longer. The transportation links were good and the location was fine.

Gabriele's communication was good throughout. The photos and descriptions give an accurate account of what to expect.

I would recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Rome."
53203,8401528,2013-10-29,5914939,Veronika,"We arrived late at night, Gabriele sister was waiting for us. She was very nice, explained everything. The apartment is spacious and very beautiful, exactly like in the pictures. Fully equipped. On the square vegetable, restaurants and cafÃ©s in the area. Termini about 20 minutes on foot. Next time we will stay there. Thanks for your help Francesca!"
53203,8581678,2013-11-06,5820967,Jessica,"We came as a group of six right at the beginning of November. Silvia gave us our tour and she was extremely bubbly and helpful. The climb up the stairs was a bit tiring because the apt is located at the top of the 5th floor, however the elevator was definitely nice to have after a long day of walking. The rooms were nice, beds comfortable. The restrooms are a bit tight, but well kept and clean.

The neighborhood is without a doubt lively at night, with local pizzerias, bars, and a club nearby. It's the perfect place to live if you ever need a midnight snack. The coffee bar right downstairs is also a perk for breakfast in the morning, as well as numerous fruit/vegetable stations nearby. 

The airport van service that was recommended on the apartment website was well worth the money! You do not want to pull your luggage from the train station through cobblestone streets. There is a nearby tram stop that is useful, and a train station that's about a 15 minute walk away.  

Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay in Rome and we were satisfied with our selection."
53203,12143241,2014-04-24,3014754,Jeff,"This apartment is in a great location out of the hustle and bustle of the city, especially when we were there for the Easter period. Sylvia was kind enough to meet us down the street when we were a little list getting to the apartment. She was very helpful giving us information re the apartment and the surrounding areas. The apartment was perfect we will definitely stay there again.  "
53203,14439007,2014-06-19,15601011,Bobby,"The apartment was exactly what we expected from the photos posted on web site. The rooms are big and airy, beds are firm but comfortable. We wish there is a comfy sofa for us to sit, relax and rest after a day's of sightseeing.
The water heater was not working on the second day but when we called the host to report the problem, it was repaired and fixed promptly.
Overall we are satisfied with the apartment. 
Thank you for having us!"
53203,15407920,2014-07-08,14523628,Cristina,"Gabriele was easy to reach and to communicate with to let him know our actual arrival time; he met us at the property and walked us through the apt.  He also provided us with helpful information about the neighborhood, practical information about where to catch the tram, the bus etc.  There were several maps of Rome in the apt and he took the time to situate us on the map.

The apartment was as pictured, very comfortable, clean and spacious, with plenty of natural light from the windows and nice, cold air conditioning.  We were a group of six and it was great to have actual bedrooms/beds for everyone, and the two bathrooms made it possible to get our group ready more quickly in the morning.  The bathroom in the hallway is set up in a way that the sink and mirror can be used while someone else is in the shower, which was helpful.  There is plenty of storage space and surface space, with each bedroom having a large wardrobe and tables, and mirrors to help in getting dressed.

The apt is also well equipped as to towels, pots, pans, dishes, etc.  The dining room gave us a place to gather and plan our day and the comfortable kitchen allowed us to prepare breakfast every morning, with fresh fruit, bread and amazing cheeses and preserves from a local market that is about two blocks away.  The washing machine worked well and was a nice thing to have several days into traveling.

The neighborhood is definitely lively.  There were hordes of young people spilling out of the bars and cafes in the area surrounding the apt when we came home late each night; but rather than annoying it was pleasant to hear the laughter and the lively chatter as we made our way home.  Noise was NOT a problem once in the apartment and we had peaceful, restful sleep.

It was a little farther from the historic center than we anticipated, but once you get the tram/bus down itâs not difficult to get around, and the value in comfort and space is well worth the extra minutes.  We only wish we had had more time in Rome to explore and enjoy the neighborhood.  Thank you Gabriele, for a lovely stay!
"
53203,19268676,2014-09-09,7350467,Paggie,"We had a great time during our stay in Roma. Gabriele's apartment had everything we need and made us feel comfortable. One thing needs to be mentioned is Gabriele was not able to come to the apartment when we arrived but still let us had a clear brief about the house and surrounding conducted by his friend. That's really helpful. By the way, the airport pick up service arranged by Gabriele was also very nice."
53203,21198076,2014-10-13,18266071,Manuela,"Great flat in a vibrant area.  We were met by Gabriele's girlfriend and got the lowdown on the trams and buses etc.  You soon realise the flat is perfectly located to feed your historical interests during the day and if like me you are not too keen on overpriced eateries you can return to the area's many bars and restaurants in the little side streets in the evening. A real plus   for art lovers, in the adjacent street the No 3 tram stops directly outside the National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art and MACRO. "
53203,24599163,2014-12-31,18755185,Alexandre,"Very nice flat in Rome. Close to tramway direct to Coliseum and close to Termini station. Gabriele is very carefull, his flat is fully equiped.

I would next time choose a closer location to the city center; however. All in all no complaints and the space is great."

We were travelling with friends (2 couples with 1 teenager kid) and the apartment with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms was a perfect fit for the purpose. It is a really nice cosy and I would say stylish apartment in a dormitory area in Rome. The host was extremely helpful explaining all the house rules, directions to get to the main city attractions and great places to eat and shop around. Gabriel spoke fluent English and it was very easy to communicate. He kindly offered us a map of the city and laminated instructions on how to get to the main city attractions and this was all very useful for âfreshâ tourists. There are public bus lines running around the place and I would recommend to use the recommendations from the host on public transportation and directions on how to get to the city center. The description and photos of the apartment all truly reflect the reality. The apartment is clean, nicely decorated and has all the necessary kitchen and other home appliances such as iron, iron desk etc. and even all the toiletries (shampoo, bath gel etc). The only thing that was missing to me was the hair dryer. There is a Carrefour market just a couple of blocks away where one can buy all the necessary things for the short stay. Overall it was an enjoyable stay in Gabrielâs place and I would highly recommend it to people travelling to Rome. I would also like to say special thanks to Gabriel for accommodating our late arrival time in spite he was late.

53203,52445059,2015-10-29,32950672,Myles,"Our experience at the apartment was nothing short of amazing. Our host, Marta, supplied us with everything we needed. The apartment was spacious. Three bedrooms that are able to accommodate 2-3 people each. The 2 bathrooms were also very clean. Although we did not meet Marta personally, we were able to meet her friend, Silvia, who let us in and gave us a lengthy tour of the house and explained many how-to's in Rome.

Overall, Marta was very kind and helpful, even going so far as to book us transportation to Flumicino Airport at a moment's notice. 

Would definitely recommend this place to a group of friends!"
53203,58512317,2016-01-03,23375097,Ramon,"Nuestra llegada fue hacia las 10 de la maÃ±ana y el padre de Gabriele, nos enseÃ±Ã³ el apartamento. Gabriele parece ser que estaba de vacaciones. Realmente el apartamento estÃ¡ muy bien y es tal y como se ve en el anuncio.  Francesca, la hermana de Gabriele y siempre por mail, estuvo en contacto con nosotros y nos reservÃ³ los transfers desde el aeropuerto y su casa.  No tuvimos informaciÃ³n sobre los transportes o como movernos desde el apartamento. la verdad es que nos organizamos bien gracias al (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps. El metro estÃ¡ a unos 20 minutos caminando.El inconveniente, es que el apartamento estÃ¡ en un 5Âº piso, y si el ascensor no funciona, pues no es fÃ¡cil subir y bajar. Tuvimos la mala suerte de estar 4 dÃ­as por fin de aÃ±o y de los cuÃ¡les, 3 dÃ­as, no funcionÃ³ el ascensor.  No es recomendable para personas discapacitadas, pues ademÃ¡s para acceder al ascensor desde el exterior hay una puerta con escaleras y unos 10 escalones.
El barrio, no es el mÃ¡s bonito de Roma, todo lo contrario, es un barrio marginal en el cuÃ¡l, muchas calles por la noche no tienen la iluminaciÃ³n encendida. Por lo tanto por la noche o te mueves en taxi o no es agradable el paseo de 20 minutos por esas calles. Nosotros no lo dudamos y nos gastamos una fortuna en taxis.
Cuando querÃ­amos ir al centro por la noche en taxi, los taxis no venÃ­an y debÃ­as de buscarlos por la calle. No es aconsejable para ir con niÃ±os en absoluto y gente mayor, tampoco.
REPITO, el apartamentp PRECIOSO, pero con mala situaciÃ³n."

Da Gabriele nicht in der Stadt war an dem Tag der Ankunft, wurden wir von Eva eingecheckt (unsere Koffer durften wir sogar schon frÃ¼her in die Wohnung bringen). Eva war sehr nett und hat alles super erklÃ¤rt.
Die Lage der Wohnung ist auch super, 15 min zu FuÃ vom Hauptbahnhof, von wo aus man Ã¼berall gut hinkommt. Abends ist viel los, wenn man nochmal in der Gegend was essen oder trinken mÃ¶chte. Insgesamt war es ein toller Aufenthalt und wir haben uns sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt! "
53203,107308052,2016-10-10,27678146,Sven,We had a very pleasant four day stay at Gabriele's appartment in San Lorenzo. Everything was perfect and we were even allowed to stay a bit longer on our last day since our flight had been reschudeled by ten hours (tipp: do not book via Seat24 and do not fly with Vueling). The neighbourhood is whil not fancy really nice (tipp: there is a nice bar just around the corner).
53203,109053943,2016-10-19,76343436,Veronica,"Gabriele was a fantastic host! He was informative and provided us with valuable information about places to eat and ways to traverse the area. He answered our questions and was readily available to us at all times. The neighborhood was quaint and safe. It is a college area and we observed several student aged patrons congregating around the corner at a bar several nights during our stay. It was amusing to watch. We (three women) felt very safe and did not worry about pickpockets or any other negative things some travellers may have experienced. The area is close to Rome city center by taxi or other public transportation. I would definitely recommend budgeting for taxis if you want quicker transport. Though, if they busses are on time, you may get to your destination, traveling by bus will be fine. I rate this stay 10 out of 10...would do again. "

As an observation for other families. I was traveling with 2 small children and the location is not the most convenient, I was shocked about the amount of dog waste on the streets and at times I didn't feel comfortably safe around neighborhood, specially at night; on the other hand if you are traveling only with adult people you will find a lot of things to do and a very busy nightlife around the area.

53203,223986514,2018-01-02,145907558,Moritz,"Wir waren Ã¼ber Silvester zu 6. fÃ¼r 5 NÃ¤chte in Gabrieles Wohnung.
Die Beschreibung und Bilder sind gut und genau.
Der Check-in und check-out war kein Problem.
Die Wohnung war sauber, das Internet funktionierte gut und die KÃ¼che war mit allem ausgestattet was man braucht.
Die BÃ¤der waren leider etwas schimmelig und eine der beiden KlospÃ¼lungen funktionierte nicht richtig. 
Die Wohnung eignet sich hervorragend fÃ¼r 6 Personen. 
In unmittelbarer NÃ¤he gibt es SupermÃ¤rkte und zahlreiche Kneipen, Cafes und Restaurants. Wir haben hilfreiche Tipps erhalten wo man gut essen kann.
Zu FuÃ ist sie circa 15 Minuten vom Hauptbahnhof entfernt. Dort befindet sich auch die Metro, mit der man zu allen SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten fahren kann."
53203,258068247,2018-04-28,111668446,Xhena,"I stayed here with three friends for 4 months during a semester studying in Italy. The apartment was really beautiful and two of the rooms looked out onto a big square. It had all the amenities we needed to stay for a long time, like a big fridge and washing machine. The neighborhood is a student neighborhood so itâs quite lively and has a lot of cool local places nearby. Gabriele and his sister were quick to help us with any issues we had. Overall we had a great stay!"
53203,259626707,2018-05-01,104935757,Alessia,"Lâappartamento corrisponde alle foto, ho utilizzato la culla messa a disposizione dallâhost e confermo che Ã¨ in ottime condizioni. Il nostro passeggino Ã¨ un poâ largo per cui abbiamo avuto qualche difficoltÃ  in ascensore e allâingresso dellâappartamento ma chiudendolo siamo riusciti a trasportarlo. Vicino a fermata tram e bus, piÃ¹ scomodo raggiungere la metro anche perchÃ© bisogna attraversare il quartiere attorno alla stazione (non tra i migliori). Host molto disponibile e veloce nelle risposte!"

We appreciated the A/C units in each room in August, and loved having access to the washing machine, dishwasher, and a fully equipped kitchen. The San Lorenzo neighborhood has lots of great affordable, quality restaurants and bars and we found it very easy to get to the center by bus or walking. Highly recommend staying here!"

53203,334004516,2018-10-08,67597294,Gino,"Excellent apartment for larger family or if more than two adults, given the 3 bedrooms and two full bathrooms. San Lorenzo is a grittier neighborhood than what a tourist might expect in Rome. In our case, this is what we wanted. Except for one tram trip, we walked everywhere within the walled city. The apartment is on the top (5th) floor but there is one of those old-style elevators that worked fine. Location is in a small piazza that has an excellent restaurant next door, a cafe/bar/eatery and a fresh fruit/produce market. Two supermarkets 1-2 blocks away.
Only negative is the slight but persistent odor which appears to originate from the drains. This in no way affected our stay but guests should know about it."

53203,473317360,2019-06-21,12423793,Sanjay,We enjoyed our stay there. Place is close to station and apartment is good.
53203,482195774,2019-07-06,142429221,Maddie,"This apartment was perfect for our family of 4, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, which suited us perfectly. One thing that we found that differed from the description of the apartment and the other reviews listed was that it was not as easy to get to and from central Rome as we had thought. During the day, we usually took the number 3 tram, which was fine. However, after about 6pm, the trams seemed to become more erratic - we waited 45 minutes for a number 3 from Trastevere one evening. Furthermore, we found the number 71 bus to be atrocious. The one time we did manage to catch it, which was around 8am, was after waiting for 30 minutes, and the next couple of times we tried, multiple buses did not show up. On our penultimate night, we waited around 50 minutes, by which point there should have been at least 3 if not 4 buses, and we saw none going in either direction. This was extremely frustrating and made us all really angry at wasting our limited time in the city. 

In addition to this, it is worth noting that taxi drivers will rip you off massively - hence our insistence on taking public transport. Gabriele informed me that the best way to get from the airport to the apartment was to take a taxi - a flat rate of 30 euros from Ciampino and 48 from Fiumicino, which is printed on the side of the taxi. He even told us where to get dropped off so that we would be within the Aurelian walls - where the rate applied. We asked multiple taxi drivers to take us to inside the walls for 30 euros and they flat out refused, were argumentative and rude. If you are travelling here it is worth knowing that the taxi drivers will do this, and it might be better to get one of the airport shuttle buses to Termini and then walk from there. 

Finally, it would have been nice to have something left for us in the apartment when we arrived. We really don't expect a lot, but our host knew we would be arriving late in the day, and it would have been thoughtful to have left some milk or even just some water in the fridge for us when we arrived. In addition to this, the only face to face interaction we had with Gabriele was when we checked out, which we all found to be quite awkward. We were told the check-out time would be 10.30am, and so were quite surprised when Gabriele showed up at 10.25, whilst we were doing our final checks and bathroom trips. Despite trying to engage him in conversation, he didn't seem very interested and in fact seemed a little bit annoyed that we were still there, which wasn't the nicest way to end our trip. 

Ultimately, the apartment itself is great, and we found a lot of nice places to go around San Lorenzo. However, if you want to do a lot in central Rome, I would consider what I have said about the transport options before making this booking."

Your place was fantastic, and made our stay so nice ! Thanks for such an easy communication, making our arrival to Rome and the flat, seamless. Thanks for your guidance and recommendations to discover the city and its food ! Our bellies thank you !!! Finally, the location of the flat was great - walking distance to the university, away from the touristic area and only 15min north of Termini.

53203,570724880,2019-11-30,82462803,Sarah,Gabrieleâs apartment is very nice and clean. It is situated central but not in the touristic area of Rome. But you can still walk easily to lots of the sightseeing attractions!
53265,1152419,2012-04-19,2004065,Sarah,"Lovely bright apartment just as described, On a quiet street, it  looks out on Santa Maria al Fornaci which is a very active church, so fun to people watch. Quick walk to the Vatican and only one block to the start of the 64 bus so you can be sure to get a seat and avoid any jostling  Aldo and Stefano provided some tasty and welcome cheeses, fruit and pastries on our arrival and plenty of coffee and milk. We had a wonderful stay--many thanks!"
53265,1817797,2012-07-28,2129217,Jaime,"Aldo and Stefano were great hosts and the apartment is beautiful, spacious and has everything needed. Having wifi was very handy and the kitchen is fully equipped so you can enjoy the pleasures of cooking Italian in Italy.  Aldo and Stefano responded immediately to any issues,  and the location is great - close to everything but not in a tourist area. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
53265,2031264,2012-08-19,3053678,Julien,The guest were really carefully before and after the trip. The flat was really clean. 200m from the Vatican. So a little bit away from the city center but you can reach it easily by bus (n64) or by metro ( 600m away lone red) and anyway the best way to discover Roma is to get lost and walk. I really recommend it!

It is in a very quiet, nice local feeling area with deli, wine shop and restaurants within 1-2 blocks. It is about a block from the San Pietro stop on bus 64 which goes through town all the way to termini station, which was easy to get off and walk to most of the sights in Rome. The apartment was very clean and well equipped, and Aldo and Stefano were very helpful and quick to respond to a minor issue. We would stay here again if/when we return to Rome. "

The location; close to the Vatican;  allowed us to go everywhere we wanted either  by foot or public transportation. The area around the apt has shops, cafes, many restaurants and a view of the Dome of St Peters once you leave the building; especially beautiful at night all lit up. We would stay there again without question.

53265,2758495,2012-10-30,2136355,John,"This charming, roomy apartment in an interesting part of Rome made our stay in the city enjoyable and memorable. The views from the windows were magical. Everything needed for a comfortable stay was in the apartment and Aldo and Stefano provided us with all the help we needed, and with supplies when we arrived to make settling in easy. It's being some distance from many of the things we wanted to see in Rome (except St Peter's and the Vatican which are right next door almost) was no problem because the handy bus service was just a short walk away. A good-sized supermarket was an easy walking distance away and there were plenty of small local shops, cafes and restaurants right to hand."

Stefano greeted us and was so helpful and kind. The apartment was very lovely, spacious and everything we could have wanted. Having a kitchen was great as we could have a night in when our feet needed it.

We will definitely stay again next time in Rome."

First of all, the hosts were wonderful and took care of all the small details promptly. They were very responsive to my queries and the experience of renting the place was very smooth. 

The apartment itself is a gem. It felt like being at home ! They have taken care of every little detail and the apartment lacked for nothing. This is not 5 star luxury, but for us this was better than luxury. We were travelling with a 12 month baby and wanted a place that was spacious, clean and convinient. This apartment was perfect. The apartment is spacious, safe, very clean and has wonderful large windows with a lively Rome view below. It is right next to Vatican city and has very good public transport ( bus\metro ) connectivity to the rest of the city. We even walked to Piazza Novona from here. Cabs to most locations cost us about 10 euros.

There were a bunch of casual restaurants within a block of this place and nicer restaurants were about a 5 minute walk away.

Would strongly recommend this place if you want a peaceful place to call home in Rome !"

Aldo and Stefano were also great to communicate with- they are kind, accommodating and considerate. There are plenty of grocery, bakery, restaurants nearby for those needs and public transport to the center of town is quite nearby. Also to walk to the historical center of Rome is about 15 minutes. 
I would also highly recommend this place as others have done! "

It was a real home away from home, with a lovely relaxing lounge, very comfortable bed, lovely quaint kitchen and cool air conditioning which is so important on these hot summer days. I can highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Rome, as it is right next door go the Vatican and walking distance to all major attractions.  A supermarket is just up the road for groceries and many restaurants nearby. The host was very helpful and all the books on Rome in the lounge room came in very handy.

53265,8735084,2013-11-14,7729619,Andy,"We loved the apartment with its spacious living room, two windows looking out two different directions over a large piazza and a dramatic church facade.  Two nice couches as well. 

The apartment is on the 4th floor, accessible by an ancient Otis elevator with its old world charm.  The bed is comfortable, the bath and kitchen quite adequate.  The kitchen was more equipped than other airbnb's we stayed at in Italy.

St Peter's is just down the street, and the direction to head if you want to walk over to Rome proper. It's a pleasant walk all the way.

The location is a residential area with tall buildings. It doesn't have the ambiance of a Trastavere, but it's got a good location out of the main hubub. There are food stores nearby, and restaurants toward St. Petes.

Aldo and Stephano were quite helpful, even helping call at taxi at 6:30 AM and confirming back with us when it arrived."

The apartment was in a good condition and in a wonderful location, enabling us to go around Rome by walking. I also appreciate Aldo & Stefano making us an exception and accepting us with two small babies, which I am sure is scary to any host :)! However I believe we proved it can all be done smoothly! :)
Also, big thanks for the wine and cake that was left for us! I highy recommend this apartment and its lovely hosts!"
53265,12217612,2014-04-26,10938696,Martin,"We stayed a few days in the apartment of Aldo & Stefano. We felt home immediately due to the warm welcome by Aldo. Both Stefano and Aldo are very friendly and willing to answer questions or to help out if required. Oh, and this is not because of the delicious bottle of wine they left us in the fridge :) 

About the apartment then. Lots is said by others and I will try not to repeat too much of that. 
Except, yes it's situated in the centre of Rome. And it is around the corner of the Vatican. Also other places are easy to reach by foot if you want.

The interior is very classic and comfortable. Both bed room and living room are equipped with airco. The living contains a cosy cough and is very large. The telephone can be used for local calls. Convenient when you need a taxi for instance.
Btw, there is an elevator for your luggage. 

The bed room is large and the bed is comfortable. Even for a tall guy like me (1.86m). Enough space to put clothes and other things if you want. 
Kitchen is equipped with all basic utilities. So if you want to cook it should be possible. 
For two persons there is more than enough room. Even three would be no problem. If you would let someone sleep on the couch.
The bath room is not large. But ok enough. The shower is rather small. There is an hair dryer and so. 

We had some a small issue with the WiFi, but resetting (on-off) the router solved it. Also the cranes are a bit loose. If you look around closely, left and right a bit of maintenance is required. But let this not prevent you staying at this apartment. I am sure it will be fixed and things are not broken. The place is  just too well situated, close to the various historic places Rome offers"

Location wise - it's located conveniently only at 5-7 min walking  distance from the Vatican. There is a supermarket, many small shops, restaurants and cafes nearby. Connection to the center is by train (10 min walk) or bus (64, close by).
The hosts were super friendly and hospitable, maintaining a very quick response rate to questions and making suggestions. 
Overall, a very positive experience and we will recommend them to anyone traveling to Rome."

53265,43766235,2015-08-22,34916348,Gloria,"Aldo was not in Rome during our stay but he arranged for someone to meet us at the apartment. He also was easily available by email. 

The description of the apartment is accurate. The apartment has large windows and is bright. The rooms are a good size. The apartment was clean. The neighborhood is a mixture of quiet apartments but just a block away from the Vatican and the metro and a few restaurants. We also found a nearby grocery store ""Carrefour"" with excellent prices and selections. We felt very safe. We highly recommend the apartment. 

We arrived Rome at the end of our cruise. We were able to use the train/metro from Rome's port to get the apartment. We were also able to use the train/metro at the end of our stay to get to the airport.  "

53265,75741996,2016-05-22,9702893,Pablo,Quiza uno de los departamentos mÃ¡s lindos en los que estuvimos por airbnb. Calido decorado con muy buen gusto. Y ubicado en un barrio tranquilo muy cerca del Vaticano. Legamos caminando a casi todos los sitios turisticos. El bus tiene parada a una cuadra y el metro a unas ocho cuadras. 
53265,77074509,2016-05-30,49498005,Emiliano,"El apartamento de Aldo E Stefano perfecto. Limpio, muy acogedor, luminoso y muy bien situado. 
El apartamento tiene muchos detalles como numerosos enchufes (lo que se agradece para recargar baterÃ­as), secador de pelo, numerosas toallas , menaje variado y mÃ¡s que suficiente, productos bÃ¡sicos de limpieza y alimentaciÃ³n (azÃºcar, cafÃ©, cacao, aceite, sal...),  incluso tenÃ­an varios productos de aseo (como gel y espuma de afeitar). 
La situaciÃ³n del apartamento es muy buena. A 5 minutos del Vaticano. Una zona muy tranquila y con varios comercios alrededor (fruterÃ­a, panaderÃ­a y supermercado). Cerca del apartamento pasan varias lÃ­neas de autobuses que llevan a distintos puntos de la ciudad.
A nuestra llegada nos recibieron con una botella de vino, todo un detalle, y una caja de galletas para el desayuno.
Ha sido una muy buena experiencia alojarse en el apartamento de Aldo y Stefano. Nos hemos sentido como en casa."

Extremely close to St. Peter, with a wonderful view. 
Would definitely stay here again if i ever go back to Rome.

"
53265,82230016,2016-06-26,55160484,Bart,"This apartment is a gem. It is aptly described as ""nice and bright."" The living room with its big windows facing south and east is a delightful place to sit at any time of day. The location, literally two blocks from the St. Peter's Basilica, is ideal for people visiting the Vatican. The neighborhood offers several shops where you can buy food if you want to cook some meals in the apartment. There are also cafes and restaurants in easy walking distance.
The apartment is on the fourth floor and is serviced by a quaint old elevator. It was clean; the bed was comfortable; and the kitchen is well stocked with all the plates, glasses, and cookware you'll need. We also used the clothes washer and the drying lines on the rooftop terrace, which offered a unique view of the dome of St. Peter's.
Aldo and Stefano could not have been better hosts. They met us at the apartment, stocked the refrigerator with beer and bottled water, and left a complimentary bottle of wine on the kitchen counter. Aldo also came to our rescue when we had left a bag behind at one of the places we visited. Speaking virtually no Italian ourselves, we asked Aldo to make a call to find out if the bag had been found. He did so right away. Our bag was found, and we were able to pick it up the following day.
The only potential issue to be aware of is that the shower is on the small side. It was fine for us, but a very tall or large person might find it a bit too snug.
We highly recommend this Nice and Bright apartment. If we have an opportunity to return to Rome, we would not hesitate to return to the same apartment. "
53265,83431339,2016-07-02,3773737,Theresa,"Our stay in Italy was for our wedding honeymoon and Aldo and Stefano's apartment was perfect, we absolutely loved it. They were such amazing hosts. Such quick responses when we needed something or questions asked. The even called and reserved a taxi to pick us up at 4am to catch our flight during our check out. The apartment is spotless so clean and fully equipped that we enjoyed cooking in when we had the chance. They stocked up our fridge with tons of beverages. The view of the Vatican is beautiful from the apartment window and Terrace of the building. The apartment is actually really spacious and big for two people. It was so easy to walk around to near by shops, restaurants, and main grocery store which is open 24 hours and just a ten minute walk. The walk to the Basilica  doesn't even take more then ten minutes maybe even less. If we decide to go back we will definitely be staying at the apartment again. I highly recommend anyone going to visit Rome to stay here. Thank you Aldo and Stefano for allowing us to experience our trip comfortably and memorable :) "
53265,84744172,2016-07-08,54131225,Michael,Great stay. Very good location and gracious hosts. I'd like to see rules and other description available in other languages other than Italian. Maybe AIRBNB should provide it. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Aldo E Stephano!

53265,109751296,2016-10-23,2479136,Pamela,"This apartment is full of light and air, and really well set up for both short and long stays. One of my very favourites.  Just one note; the bus route No 64 takes you to the city centre, (the distance is walkable too), and to Termini (which is not) so watch out for strikes, particularly on Fridays. Ask locals if you seem to be waiting too long. There is a good taxi rank if needed. Aldo e Stefano will be a great help with directions."

Aldo et Stefano sont parfaits "
53265,141827764,2017-04-05,4835803,Donna,This is a safe clean and beautiful apartment just a few steps away from Vatican City. The house is very quiet so you can rest and recuperate well from days of walking or sightseeing--the nearby church rings its bells at 7:15am which I find is a perfect wake up call. Bus 64 (which will take you within walking distance of most of the famous sites) is nearby and frequent. 
53265,143527178,2017-04-12,113383115,LeeWei,"We really enjoy staying in Aldo e Stefano's place for the following reasons: The location is superb. It's 5 minutes walk to St. Peter's Square, yet, without the crowd and noises of the tourists. Many local restaurants and a 24 hour grocery store nearby. You feel like a local Roman. The apartment is sunny, homey and clean with a view of St. Peter basilica from living room window. We will definitely stay here if we come back to Rome again in the future.
Thank you for your hospitality.

53265,151727470,2017-05-14,92736963,Jessica,"This apartment was the perfect home base for our stay in Rome. Aldo and Stefano were wonderful hosts. They met us at the apartment for check in and were very patient as we were a little late due to our confusion with the train schedule. They gave us many wonderful recommendations for places to eat and where to go for the best views of the beautiful city. 
The location is walking distance to many restaurants, a taxi stand, the train station, and Vatican City. There is a 24 hour grocery store also within walking distance which proved necessary since we are used to eating a little more for breakfast than the typical Italian. 
The apartment was quiet and had all the necessary amenities, and the bed was extremely comfortable. If we return to Rome we will definitely stay here again. "

The apartment has a great location very close to the Vatican and also walking distance to much of central Rome. Bus route 64 is within two blocks and the Ottaviano Metro Station is also an easy walk for longer trips. Many restaurants are close by. I could not provide a higher recommendation for the apartment."

Communication regarding directions and local travel options from you was excellent, we found the location very easily & and the ease of public transport was great, especially with St Peters station just at the top of the road.  We will be recommending you to our friends and family when they visit Rome later this year. "
53265,166287745,2017-07-03,16178582,Leann,"We found the apartment exactly as expected. It is in a beautiful old building just down the street from the Vatican. The bus to the center of Rome stops just 1 minute walk away. The bed is comfortable and the kitchen is small, but functional for small meals. There is a grocery store near by as well as other shops and restaurants. The elevator was great to have. The big windows and open space made it very comfortable for a long stay."

We weren't disappointed!  Although very busy during the day and with church bells ringing right next door everything quieted down at night time.  Conveniently located a couple of blocks from the Vatican and pretty much walking distance to everything in Rome.  Surprisingly some good restaurants, pizzerias, mini-markets, gelato, close by.

Sie liegt nahe am Petersplatz, die Innenstadt ist zÃ¼gig und problemlos zu erreichen.
Wir wurden herzlich empfangen, freundlich in alle Details eingefÃ¼hrt, und fanden im KÃ¼hlschrank Wassser, Bier, Saft und Wein vor - Ã¼berhaupt ist die FÃ¼rsorglichkeit, die unkomplizierte und rasche Kommunikation, und das NatÃ¼rliche und pragmatisch Problemlose mit Aldo und Stefano als besonders und angenehm hervorzuheben.

Im KÃ¼hlschrank befanden sich GetrÃ¤nke als Geschenk. Eine nette aufmerksame Geste,  gerade wenn man eine lange Anreise hat. 

Die Kommunikation im Vorfeld verlief immer schnell, nett und unkompliziert, ebenso die Ãbergabe der Wohnung. Der Gastgeber wartete bereits auf uns vor der HaustÃ¼r, als wir ankamen.

No problem....all of those amenities are conveniently provided for. 

Close to public transportation, including Roma S. Pietro station (which can get you to/from the airport with one transfer, or directly to Roma Termini train station) and the #64 bus, which connects the Vatican, Campo di fiore, Piazza Venezia, and the Coliseum."

5 stars !!!

Thanks again, Pat"

We loved staying in the bright apartment and really enjoyed having some space instead of just a small hotel room.  The apartment itself is quite large according to Italian standards!  Aldo and Stefano were great about communicating with us in  a timely fashion and were kind enough to help us schedule a taxi on our last day to get to the airport.  We really appreciated this!  They also had some nice touches ready for us when we arrived- some waters, juices, and beers in the fridge, as well as tea, coffee, and fresh fruit.  Check in was a breeze and we appreciated having someone with us (their colleague, Vito) to show us how to work the washing machine and answer our last minute questions etc.  Thank you again!"

Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a wonderful time in Rome."
53265,307932806,2018-08-15,6216716,Don,"Perfect place to stay! We stayed two weeks in early August, 2018. Though the temperature outside was in the 90's (F) most days, the air conditioners in the bedroom and the living room kept the apartment nicely cool. The elevator worked perfectly. There were nice touches left for us in the kitchen. WIFI worked perfectly without any glitches whatsoever, and is a fast speed. Apartment is small, but comfortable. We would stay there again without any hesitation. Numerous bus stops nearby, regional train station nearby (both walking distance) and one stop on the train to the metro. Easy walking distance to St. Peter's, and the Vatican. Quiet neighborhood. Bus #64 goes to the major historical area in just a short time. Numerous small shops and restaurants nearby as well as a grocery store about 10 minutes walk away. A single use ticket gives you 100 minutes to use any combination of bus, regional train, and metro (metro entrance only once) for 1.50 Euros, a very good deal, and can get you anywhere in Rome.
The shower is a bit small. I am 6'4"" tall and weigh 300 pounds and just barely could fit into the shower, but average size people (including my wife) would have (had) no trouble. (Not to worry, I was able to shower:-)
Again, we would happily stay here again in a moments notice."

Pour ceux qui souhaiteraient dÃ©couvrir les dÃ©licieux vins italiens, Ã  noter un excellent et sympathique marchand de vins, Vini, juste en bas de lâimmeuble!
Aldo et Stefano, dont je ne peux que louer la gentillesse, ont toujours rÃ©pondu trÃ¨s rapidement Ã  nos questions et ont Ã©tÃ© arrangeants sur nos horaires dâarrivÃ©e et de dÃ©part. Merci beaucoup Ã©galement Ã  Aline et Vito pour leur chaleureux accueil. Une trÃ¨s belle dÃ©couverte, encore mieux que sur les photos, qui ne peut que donner envie de revenir!"

53265,343587050,2018-11-01,88735668,Martin,"Uns hat die Wohnung sehr gut gefallen. Zum Petersdom ist es nur ein Katzensprung, Bus und Supermarkt fuÃlÃ¤ufig zu erreichen. FÃ¼r groÃe Personen ist die DeckenhÃ¶he ideal, das Bett ebenfalls. Die Dusche ist ein wenig eng, wussten wir aber vorher und war fÃ¼r uns kein Problem. Aldo und Stefano waren jederzeit schnell per Mail zu erreichen und haben uns schon im Vorfeld bei Fragen zur Anreise vom Flughafen in die Wohnung geholfen."
53265,349409992,2018-11-17,89892193,Niklas,Wir haben uns wÃ¤hrend unserer Zeit in Rom in dieser tollen Wohnung sehr wohlgefÃ¼hlt. Dank der sehr guten Lage der Wohnung konnten wir alles zu FuÃ erreichen - auch der Petersplatz ist nur 5 Minuten entfernt. Ein Supermarkt sowie Restaurants und CafÃ©s befinden sich ebenso ganz in der NÃ¤he. Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und Ã¼beraus gemÃ¼tlich und komfortabel eingerichtet. Der Kontakt zu Aldo und Stefano hat sehr gut funktioniert und wir wurden bei unserer Ankunft sehr nett empfangen. Wir kÃ¶nnen diese schÃ¶ne Wohnung nur empfehlen!
53265,368564149,2019-01-07,22299078,Corinne,"Aldo et Stefano sont des hÃ´tes accueillants, gÃ©nÃ©reux, sympathiques et trÃ¨s rÃ©actifs. Plein de gentilles attentions nous attendaient. Nous avons passÃ© 15 jours parfaits dans cet appartement oÃ¹ nous nous sommes vraiment sentis ""Ã  la maison"". La hauteur sous plafond est magnifique - le soleil qui entre le matin - le grand canapÃ© et le lit, trÃ¨s confortables - cafÃ©, thÃ©, chocolat, huile, Ã©pices..., lessive, draps, serviettes - l'emplacement, tout prÃ¨s de Saint-Pierre, de la gare de San Pietro, des bus...

53265,412708852,2019-02-16,212069827,Rodger,"What a wonderful apartment for our week in Rome in mid-February! My wife & I were looking for a place close to St. Peter's and within walking distance to a metro stop, so Aldo & Stefano's was perfect. The Vatican was a short 5-minute walk, the Ottoviono metro about 15 minutes and a full-sized grocery store about 10 minutes. The apartment is very clean and includes large his & her closets, a very comfortable bed, a bright & sunny sitting room and a well-stocked kitchen. Excellent internet access. The washing machine was convenient for keeping up as the week went along. The morning bells of St. Mary of Grace across the street were the perfect alarm clock. The building is very quiet, secure and has a typical small elevator which was handy for a 4th floor apartment. We highly recommend this apartment to those looking to stay close to the Vatican and a metro. Thank you!"
53265,419011371,2019-03-03,237330433,Connor,Everything was great. Very clean and had ample amenities. We loved our stay here.

53265,425393280,2019-03-18,38183033,Miguel,"El departamento estÃ¡ impecable. Se destaca por ser espacioso y luminoso. Desde la ventana (cuarto piso) se puede ver algo de la ciudad sin tener un edificio enfrente. El ruido de la calle no afecta para nada. Si bien el barrio es tranquilo se pueden encontrar varios comercios a una cuadra, desde panaderÃ­as hasta pequeÃ±os supermercados. Igualmente, encontramos en el departamento cantidad de condimentos y ricos tÃ©s como para llegar y tomar algo sin tener que correr a comprar. Valoramos micho ese detalle. El baÃ±o es muy amplio y la ducha con buena presiÃ³n. Si bien el edificio es antiguo estÃ¡ perfectamente reformado para pasar un tiempo agradable. Hay que tener en cuenta la lejanÃ­a del Metro que fue nuestro medio de transporte. Usamos taxi en varias ocasiones ya que el dia se hace largo caminando y recorriendo. Aldo fue muy gentil al recibirnos Ã©l mismo y darnos indicaciones para alojarnos. Nos entregÃ³ dos juegos de llaves lo cual fue tambiÃ©n muy cÃ³modo para manejarnos con independencia. El Vaticano estÃ¡ tan cerca que puedes pasar a la hora que te conviene caminando unas pocas cuadras."
53265,428889128,2019-03-26,135751687,Tilly,"Die Unterkunft von Aldo und Stefano ist zentral gelegen und fuÃlÃ¤ufig vom Vatikan entfernt. Die Wohnung ist freundlich, hell und sauber. Aldo und Stefano sind sehr freundliche Gastgeber. Die KÃ¼che ist sehr gut ausgestattet und die Gastgeber haben einige GetrÃ¤nke in den KÃ¼hlschrank gestellt, so dass man bei der Ankunft den ersten Durst lÃ¶schen kann. Die WohnungsÃ¼bergabe war problemlos. Besonders schÃ¶n ist der alte Paternoster, der einem nach oben, in die Wohnung bringt.
Wir haben uns dort  sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt.

EstÃ¡ bien situado, cerca del Vaticano y con buena comunicaciÃ³n tanto con autobÃºs como con tren. La casa muy agradable, confortable, muy luminosa y con las prestaciones necesarias. Los anfitriones muy amables y detallistas, atentos a que nos sintiÃ©ramos bien en todo momento, por ejemplo nos dejaron bebidas (cerveza, champÃ¡n, agua mineral) en el frigorÃ­fico. En fin una experiencia estupenda y una casa que recomendamos a todos. Desde aquÃ­, muchas gracias a nuestros estupendos anfitriones.

53265,451202484,2019-05-11,230354361,Mark,"Spacious with good facilities. Close to St.Peters and the Vatican. Loads of local restaurants. Great Pizza take away âDavinaâsâ on the way back from the Carrefour supermarket. 2 minutes walk from Roma San Pietro station. Walking distance from all Romes sites if you are reasonably fit. Make sure to check for the free entry to the Colosseum, Palatine Hill and Roman Forum once a month. The walk to Juniculum Hill, Garibaldiâs monument and the site of St Peterâs martyrdom then in to Trastevere is fabulous. Very well located apartment only slightly away from the Rome noise. Sunday morning food market outside the door. Donât forget the flea market in Trastevere is every Sunday."
53265,457015398,2019-05-23,14109327,Bratislav,"Staying in apartment at Aldo and Stefano was a wonderful experience for my wife and me.
Close to the St Pietro train station you can easily reach from the Fiumicino airport. A lot of transportation that can be used to connect to the city, such as the bus 64 that connects to Piaca  Venecia - of course, I recommend that everything be walked, because it's better to feel Rome in a walk than driving. But you can choose what you like. Nothing is far away. The Vatican is 300m from the apartment and we practically walked every day this way. The city center and the sights are not far, and Rome itself is full of sights, so this road will be easy for you too. Close to the apartment is the Carrefour market, and there are other smaller shops, bakeries and pizzerias nearby. And I reccomand to try tiramisu in cake shop Saliola Giuseppe over the street.
The apartment is clean and spacious, sufficient for relaxation after visiting Rome. Pleasant and quiet. Equipped with all the necessary things you may need during your stay. We were 9 days and we did not miss anything. We are pleasantly welcomed and explained  us everything about the apartment necessary to be able to menage.
After spending 9 days, we can recommend apartment to anyone who wants to stay in Rome for a few days or more. We threw a coins in the Fontana di Trevi with the wish to go back to Rome and if we do that, we will return to Aldo and Stefano,  for sure!"

Fueron absolutamente flexibles con los horarios de entrada y salida, y eso nos permitiÃ³ disfrutar la ciudad mÃ¡s aÃºn! 
Cerca de todo y al mismo tiempo silencioso. 
El edificio encantador! El ascensor es de pelÃ­cula! 
De volver a Roma, seguramente volverÃ­amos al depto.
Totalmente recomendable , por ubicaciÃ³n, limpieza y calidad precio!

53265,551359861,2019-10-20,126490236,Sheryl,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this apartment.  It is in an excellent location, about a 10 minute walk to Vatican, a main bus stop is a 5 minute walk and several great restaurants nearby.  The neighborhood felt very safe and we often walked in the evening with no concerns.  
The apartment is excellent with a very nice living room area, comfortable bedroom and good bathroom with all necessities.  The kitchen is quite small but functional.  We really appreciated the water and other refreshments left for us in the fridge.  It was great to be able to do a load of laundry while staying here.
We would definitely stay here again and recommend as a great place to stay while in Rome"

53265,588160795,2020-01-04,10651114,Emanuela,"Abbiamo soggiornato nellâappartamento di Aldo e Stefano per una settimana tra fine dicembre e gennaio. Lâesperienza Ã¨ stata ottima. Siamo stati accolti da una persona di fiducia dei proprietari che ci ha illustrato nel dettaglio lâappartamento e ci ha dato dei consigli su come âvivereâ la zona. La casa Ã¨ fornita di tutto il necessario per un soggiorno confortevole. CiÃ² che mi ha colpito Ã¨ la luminositÃ  dellâappartamento. Inoltre, affacciarsi dalla finestra e vedere la facciata della chiesa di Santa Maria delle Fornaci riempie il cuore di gioia. La casa si trova a cinque minuti a piedi da San Pietro. La zona Ã¨ tranquilla e dotata di servizi (trattorie, pizzerie e supermercato). Consiglio, quindi, lâappartamento di Aldo e Stefano per vivere unâesperienza che solo la cittÃ  di Roma puÃ² dare."
53265,596569058,2020-01-23,50553168,Lynn,"What a fantastic place to call home while in Rome.  Easy train access from airport, walk to everything (or, not far from Metro), bright rooms and nice atmosphere to wind down, restaurants and grocery nearby."
53265,607910621,2020-02-19,21719244,Ivana,"Great experience! The location was perfect. The apartment is almost immediately next to Vatican, and you can walk everywhere. We were there for five days and used public transportation only to get to and from the airport. A train station is very close to the building and supermarket is very close, too. It's a safe neighborhood, a very nice old building. The apartment is pretty spacious, the kitchen is fully equipped, we didn't lack anything. Check in and check out were very smooth, and they even let us leave our luggage in the apartment till the evening on our last day.  I would definitely recommend the place."
53265,672816693,2020-10-10,36273812,Floris,"Een mooi en schoon appartement vlakbij Vaticaanstad. Er is een lift in het gebouw, waardoor je niet telkens de trap op hoeft als je slechter te been bent. Verder is alles goed te bereiken. Supermarkt in de buurt."

53322,204195,2011-03-20,401343,Wendy,Tommy was a great host.  He showed up full of energy and special recommendations of where to go and eat.  He even called up a friend who owned his favorite restaurant to make a reservation for me and my friend that very night.  I had a lovely stay in the apartment and would recommend it to anyone.
53322,352505,2011-07-04,734605,Indrani,"This space is fantastic is terms of location. It is so conveniently located and right at the heart of Campa di Fiori which is frequented by tourists and locals alike. I had a fantastic time and Tommaso was helpful in arranging everything! I know I will come back soon and would definitely recommend this place to others!

53322,573230,2011-09-27,460353,Evan,"This is THE only place you should stay if you come to Rome!  Yes, the place is amazing.  Yes, the place is in the perfect location. And, yes, the price is wonderful, BUT Tommaso is the BEST host on airbnb.  He took time to bring us espresso when we first arrived and walked us around the city for a bit to show us the places to go and avoid.  Our stay would not have been what it was without him.  Stay here in Rome.  End of story.  "
53322,1187372,2012-04-27,1408096,Nadya,"Me and my husbend spent 5 beautiful days in Rome. It was not our first time in Rome, and we exectly new what part of town we want to live. Tommy gave us this opportunity. Everything was great, apartment is really ideal situated and have everything for comfortable stay. Tommy is very good host, every time ready to solve any problem. Thank you, Tommy!"
53322,1467470,2012-06-12,81877,Justin,Perfect location.  Perfect host.  Tommy is a delight to deal with and really makes staying in one of his apartments the total Rome experience.  
53322,1690885,2012-07-12,2430225,Shameer,We booked this apartment based on the other reviews and we are glad we did. Tommy was an outstanding host - He really went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and having a good time. My wife and I enjoyed staying for a week at his apartment. The location of the apartment is absolutely perfect. Right in the center -all major sites are  within walking distance and campo de fiori is around the corner - The neighborhood is very fun with lots of local flavors and a grocery store nearby - We cant wait for our return trip and without a doubt will book with Tommy - 
53322,1739454,2012-07-18,2435823,David,"We stayed 5 nights at Tommy's Campo studio apartment and had a wonderful time! The unit was exactly as described and clean. The position is ideal, very central to all of the major attractions, or transport to them. There is a wonderful bakery around the corner and a fab Trattoria only a few streets away. There is also the Campo di Fiori itself, of course! Just a block away. The unit is very quiet and the upper floor location gives a great view from the windows. There are several flights of stairs (as there are right across Rome!) but Tommy very graciously helped with our luggage. Tommy was an excellent host, friendly and professional. We would have no hesitation staying here again and would highly recommend this unit. We would also recommend you print the location map inluded on this website so you can find your way back after a long day of sightseeing, without resorting to Hansel and Gretel measures :)
As the appartment is within walking distance to everything (except perhaps the Colesseum), make sure you take walking shoes you are used to as the cobblestones in Rome are unforgiving!

Book this and enjoy your trip!"
53322,1885346,2012-08-04,235341,Bree,I hesitated about booking the studio apartment as it is a little pricey for just one person but it was totally worth it. It is in a great area - very sociable but relaxed - and the studio is fantastic. It has everything you need and Tommy was very helpful and responsive. I recommend staying here if you are one person or a couple.
53322,1969119,2012-08-13,2672284,Laura,"Tommy was not available to meet with us so he arranged for another host Carlos to meet us. Everything was great, he met us at the unit and showed us around. He provided us with all the information we needed and was very friendly. The unit itself was excellent. It was exactly as shown on the website. The AC was amazing, it was so hot outside and it was such a relief to come back to a nice cool room. The condo is in a great location, walking distance to many popular sights and a short and inexpensive cab ride to many others. We throughly enjoying our stay and would stay here again. Thanks!"
53322,2220927,2012-09-07,667959,Wassim,"The apartment was as advertised. The location is great as it really is in the heart of Rome. Really tough to beat on that front. Tommy did accommodate us by offering an early check-out. However, one thing that disappointed us was that we exchanged a few emails about our arrival being being between 830AM-9AM. We did up arriving at 840 and no one was there to greet us. We were left waiting in the streets with our luggage til 925. It took 4 phone calls before we got a hold of Tommy/Carlos. Wasn't very pleasant given we have been flying for a whole day. But beside this unfortunate experience, we still did end up enjoy Tommy's apartment and its great location."
53322,2380090,2012-09-23,2572971,Bill,This is a great little studio in a great location.  We were very comfortable and Tommy was very friendly and helpful.  The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning was great.  There are definitely some stairs to climb but it's worth it and a great value for Rome.
53322,2603242,2012-10-14,3236099,Amirah,"Tommy was a wonderful host.  We got a little lost when we first arrived, but once we were finally able to connect with him and get turned back around, everything was fantastic.  The flat is small but had everything we needed.  The location is PERFECT and we were able to walk to every place in Rome without using public transport.  Tommy also gave us some great dinner recommendations.  We had a wonderful and will suggest his place to friends traveling to Rome in the future."
53322,2697567,2012-10-24,1389617,Sharon,Great location and apartment.  Tommy was waiting for us at the apartment and check in etc was efficient and straight forward. I have been to Rome before so was pretty happy to find our own way but Tommy was happy to send us recommendations on restaurants and sites to visit.  Would be very happy to stay there again or in another of his apartments.
53322,2764534,2012-10-30,3064112,Elizabeth,"Tommy was a wonderful host, full of great information. The room was very stylish and cosy. We would definately stay here again, the location was perfect."
53322,3225712,2013-01-02,846758,Karl,"Really so very much enjoyed staying here while visiting Rome.. and being just short block/step away from Campo di Fiori ! was a wonderful spot to be to while in Roma.. very close to walk everywhere including main sites and to Trastevere as well.. The apartment was delightful, fully equipped, and perfectly situated. Tommy a classy, and kind host was also very helpful with communications and arranged for keys on arrival.  Was really delightful and thank you very kindly for everything. "
53322,3296971,2013-01-07,3211940,Jean,"The apartment was clean and appeared as pictured. Communication with Tommy was straight forward and check in with Carlos was very easy. Access to two wifi connections was available however signal was not always the best. The area can be a little bit noisy at night, especially on weekends, however we slept well and the bed was king size. The proximity to Campo Di Fiori and location within the historical district of Rome makes the apartment very convenient and central. We would stay again and recommend the apartment as a base for first time visitors to Rome - you can pretty much walk everywhere."
53322,4221724,2013-04-20,3034285,Jenny,"Great place, great location.  Tommy was helpful and genuinely interested in making sure we enjoyed our stay.  Everything worked well--ac, wireless, plentiful hot water. Walking distance to all major sites, yet neighborhood didn't have 'touristy' feel.  Bed very comfortable; neighborhood was quiet, clean."
53322,4780818,2013-05-25,4091569,Katherine,"We had a fantastic stay in this super cute studio. The area is fantastic (Tommy had some great recommendations for pizza, coffee etc that were all within 2 mins of the place). The studio is really light, and it was great to be able to do some of our own cooking and laundry! Tommy is a really great host - he took us for breakfast when we arrived really early and gave us a little tour to help us get oriented as well as lots of recommendations for food and things to do and see which were all spot on. Recommend this place!"
53322,5111139,2013-06-13,468677,Christian Tage,"Great Host! Very informative and kind. Extremely serviceminded.

Apartment was nice and clean and situatuated right in the middle of Rome. Despite the placement it is nice and a quiet place to stay. We loved it, as everything was maximum 20 minutes away on foot.

Very recommendable!"
53322,5207576,2013-06-18,5739608,Dario,"We had a fantastic stay in Tommy's studio. He was helpful and had alot of tips of places and transport. The studio is located near all, very clean and exactly of pictures. We would stay again and recommend this studio. Tommy, obrigado!! "
53322,5290645,2013-06-23,5554827,Thomas,"We had earlier booked a first-floor apartment in the same building four or five months earlier, but shortly before we arrived, Tommy said there were problems with that apartment and offered us a fourth-floor substitute.  The fourth-floor apartment was fine, and Tommy helped us up and down with our luggage -- and even give us three (!) bottles of wine.  The apartment was exactly as advertised and the strong air conditioning was most welcome during the hot Roman days.  But the apartment was 52 steps up and 52 steps down.  Logging 208 steps a day was tiring.  But Tommy gave us a warm welcome, and I would certainly recommend the apartment for someone with younger legs."
53322,5943101,2013-07-23,1409349,Kseniya,"We visited Rome for 9 days and stayed at Tommy's apartment during that time. It was absolutely great! The room was clean and bright, we had everything we need (hair dryer, iron with iron board, washing mashine, kitchen ware). It is also possible to cook breakfasts there, however not more than omlette)) At first we agreed to reserve another apartment at the same building (more spacious), but it was occupied for few day, still Tommy moned us there since several days, it was also extremely nice! The location is great! No transport needed to move throughout the city centre! Just walking and walking! That is exactly what you should do in Rome) Have a nice trip everyone!"
53322,7371897,2013-09-17,8229151,Dave,"We had a fantastic stay at Tommy's apartment! It is so central we walked absolutely everywhere. 2mins to campo de fiori, 10 to plaza navonna, 15 to the forum and 20 to the Vatican. The apartment is really cute nd had everything we needed. Tommy was very helpful with lots of recommendations for places to visit. We'd stay here again on another visit to rome for sure."
53322,7828182,2013-10-05,8029216,Tessa,"This is an excellent place to stay in Rome. The location is great, the apartment is clean and comfortable and Tommy is a fantastic host.

The bathroom was small but adequate. The bed was quite comfortable and the A/C was great to have on the warmer days. The neighborhood is great for walking and exploring and I didn't find street noise to be a significant problem. This unit had laundry, which was great to have after 3 weeks of travel. 

Tommy was easy to communicate with and was responsive to questions. We took him up on his airport transfer offer - I would suggest doing this. I would definitely stay here again."
53322,8019551,2013-10-13,274470,Mary,"Great little studio apartment in walking distance to all the major sites in Rome. The place was exactly as reflected in the photos. Bright, lots of light, and cozy place for our honeymoon. Tommy was very responsive and professional. Gave us great tips for local restaurants to try, all on point. Would definitely recommend!"
53322,9668468,2014-01-05,4257850,Allister,"We had a great experience staying at Tommy's apartment. 

The apartment has all necessities for a comfortable stay, including washing facilities and great heating. The location is fabulous, very nearby to the Campo De Fiori but not so close that you are within the crowds.

We did not wish to use public transport unnecessarily and found from this location we could comfortable walk to almost all Roman sites, and were in a perfect location to explore the city.

Tommy was a very helpful host and very easy to communicate with.

We highly recommend this apartment!"

Situation idÃ©ale : calme et pourtant en plein coeur de Rome, on a tout fait Ã  pied. Tommy nous a accueillies avec beaucoup de gentillesse et a partagÃ© ses bonnes adresses. Climat de confiance mutuelle, c'est agrÃ©able.
Merci Tommy! Et Rome est une ville merveilleuse!
"
53322,11765404,2014-04-14,2695291,Katrin,"We had a great 3 nights stay in Rome. The location of the studio couldn't be better! Walking distance to really all points of interest, but also bus stops and tram station near by if your feet start to hurt (what will definitely happen latest on the second day). The studio is small but pretty: one room with a king size bed and a little kitchen unit. It has a small bathroom with shower which was actually better than we expected it to be in such an old house. Constant temperature and enough water! You are not allowed to throw paper into the toilet which is normal for these old houses but still took a little getting used to for us...
Tommy was a nice, reliable and helpful host for us. Over all: clear recommendation!  We threw a coin into the Trevi fountain to come back :-)"
53322,12112485,2014-04-23,7258524,Tressa,"What a great location! Tommy was a wonderful host too. He gave lots of local places to visit and even arranged several taxi pick ups for me. The studio was comfortable, clean and very central to the highlights of the city. Loved it!"

Only minor thing is the (Website hidden by Airbnb) a small and not so fresh. "

Highly recommended! 
"
53322,13882364,2014-06-07,14905407,Nina,"The location is very convenient.  We walked around to almost all the sites we visited.  There is a farmer's market and small super market nearby.  It took some time to find the place.  But once we found it, it was very easy.

The room has air-conditioning.  It is great during the summer.  Even though we didn't use the kitchen, it was more than what we expected.  Bathroom was clean.  The closet was clean.  

The apartment does not have elevator and the stairway is small.  Carrying luggage to the 5th floor was a bit of a challenge for us.  The apartment has WiFi.  There were some tour books about Rome in the room even though we didn't need to use them.  "

There was some issues with internet which Tommy responded to right away. Great host.  "
53322,23771804,2014-12-09,24032887,Cornelius,"Amazing first Airbnb experience! Tommy is a great host, always available and making things easy. He had a great tip when we couldn't find a nice restaurant and brought over additional blankets because my girlfriend had a little cold. The flat is just as on the pictures, very clean and great location. Travestere is a 10 minute walk, p. Navona 5 min, Vatican, Spanish steps and colusseum 20. Would definitely recommend this place.

53322,29062184,2015-04-03,28768292,Haeji,"Tommy's place was in the perfect location in the center of Rome where every famous destinations were in walking distance. The apartment was well furnished, cozy, comfortable and well maintained. Tommy was the best host I could ever ask for and he made my stay in Rome more enjoyable. It was my first time using airbnb and it was a perfect experience. I would definitely stay here again in future when I visit Rome again. Many thanks!! "
53322,29605134,2015-04-10,27367455,Rodi,"We went Rome on April 2015 with another couple and both stayed at two appartments of Tommy's in the same building for 5 nights. Once we arrived Fabio was waiting for us to give us the keys and welcome us. Very kind and helpful. We both stayed at the 3rd floor, Tommy arranged for us two appartments at the same floor side by side. Ok the building is old (like every building in the centre of Rome) but inside the appartment is just new & renovated. It has a small kitchen and all the equipment to cook or make a coffee (useful), aircondition, wifi (also needed) and the bathroom was very clean (like home). Hot water all the day all the hours (!!!!) The bed is just new and very comfortable & relaxing (believe me you need a good sleep after hours of walk). Also had clean towels. The situation of the house in the centre of historical Rome is just PERFECT. You don't need any transportation at all. Campo di Fiori 2 minutes by foot, Piazza Navona-Pantheon 5 minutes, Piazza Venezia-Capitolio 10 minutes, Colloseum 20 minutes), everything is close!!! We also walked to the Vatican (30 minutes) and believe me we prefer walking through the small roads of Rome. It's just beautiful. Near home we found a very nice and cheap cafe for the breakfast ( piazza Toro Argentino) and there are also restaurants around. Last day Tommy came to meet us and goodbye us. He is a great person, very friendly!!! The only bad thing of the appartment was the stairs to the 3rd floor. Generally, great place to stay, situation of building PERFECT in the Centre of Rome, appartment clean-relaxing-very good, Tommy very friendly. We had perfect time."
53322,30027164,2015-04-16,28762432,Phil,"Tommy (and Fabio) were wonderful hosts.  They provided helpful info before and during our stay and were responsive to our questions while we were in Rome.  They really made us feel welcome.  The apartment was accurately described - really charming area - though still smaller than I had anticipated (I've never seen such as small shower but it worked fine).  The only unfortunate ""surprise"" was the noise from the Jazz club across the street.  We hadn't expected that and it made it hard to sleep.  The area of Campo de Fiori is fantastic. We would definitely come back to an apartment that Tommy hosts in the area - though maybe next time a bit larger and quieter. Grazie!"
53322,30503393,2015-04-23,29045959,Marta Elda,"I arrived in Rome on a Wednesday via Ciampino airport and the host was kind enough to arrange a taxi pick me up in the airport and take me to the flat, where the hosts friend Fabio met me, showed me the flat and details about the apartment and gave me suggestions on where to eat. 
The flat is just like the pictures and perfect for anyone who wants a private and wonderful stay in Rome. 
I didn't use any public transport during my week stay in room and the flat permitted me to walk anywhere in Rome due to its closeness to most of the mayor attractions of Rome. 
We didn't have any problems at all in the flat and Fabio was always attentive to the messages I sent him and have no complaints at all
Thank you Fabio for everything, will stay here the next time I'm in Rome 
Arrivederci!!!  "

Tommy and Fabio were both very friendly and helpful and everything went really smooth."
53322,33688748,2015-05-31,31052401,Tracey,"Communication prior to the trip was non-existent. Tommy did not respond to any emails requesting information we needed for our trip, which was very frustrating and stressful. We never did hear from him.

On a positive note, Fabio was waiting for us at the apartment and was very helpful throughout our stay."

53322,35215481,2015-06-16,30941133,Carrie,"Overall we had a great experience staying at the Campo de Fiori Studio - the location was great and the room was clean and nicely decorated. The one drawback was that we were banking on being able to use the washing machine but could not get it to work right - no matter what setting we had it on it would just stop mid-cycle and not finish. We finally were able to get it to rinse and drain, but it never would do a spin cycle. But aside from this issue everything else was great. "
53322,38052649,2015-07-12,10638613,Augustin,"L'accueil Ã©tait chaleureux et ponctuel. Fabio, qui nous a accueillis, nous a donnÃ© plein de bons conseils.

It is a gem in the center of Rome and Tommy is a jewel; he was so very kind and generous with his time and dedication to making my stay the best it could be. This is the first time I ever used Airbnb and thanks to this experience, I will use it again. When I return to Rome, if I need a place to stay, I will most certainly always use Tommy exclusively!"
53322,40352943,2015-07-30,8369279,Kaitlin,Had a great stay here in Rome. Tommy and Fabio were both very helpful and welcoming. They gave us lots of suggestions for local eats. We loved having the market right around the corner and being able to walk to all of the big sights in Rome.
53322,43669734,2015-08-21,23768405,Alice,"Le studio est identique aux photos et ne dÃ©Ã§oit pas. Celui-ci est Ã  deux pas des lieux touristiques, en plein centre. Il est ensoleillÃ© dans l'aprÃ¨s-midi, calme et disposant des Ã©quipements nÃ©cessaires. Le lit est confortable, l'appartement trÃ¨s bien dÃ©signÃ©.
Concernant l'hÃ´te, nous n'avons pas vu Tommy mais une de ses collaboratrices  ""Silvia"" qui parlait trÃ¨s bien franÃ§ais."
53322,47056935,2015-09-15,39879552,Barney,"Firstly, the location is fantastic, and that's really what you're paying for. The apartment is tiny - it is a studio after all. And a little tatty with cheap panels etc. Couldn't close the door to the bathroom.

Tommy had a new rule about a penalty for using a towel to wipe the floor, but he should ask himself why anyone would do this. Well it's because the floor is dirty - it needs a proper vacuuming and mopping.

I appreciated the washing machine and powder. Overall fair value, and that's mainly based on the location."
53322,48181788,2015-09-24,13301361,Leonardo,"Tommy was great, helping us with everything we needed. For those who are brazilian, he speaks portuguese and loves the country!

The check in was nice, even with our train have being delay, tommy was there to meet us.

The apartment is good, with a fantastic location, right beside campo de' fiore and 5 min walking from piazza navona and the pantheon, and close to trastevere and other monuments. It is located on top of what was pompeo theather! Oh, don't need to say that there are a lot of restaurants around.

The only negative thing about the place is that the wifi was not very good, and the apartment is located on the 4th floor I guess, and there is no elevator!

I recomend the apartment for a nice stay in Rome!"
53322,50068521,2015-10-09,9222928,Kutay,"The host is very nice and gave us all the information we needed to have (restaurants, sights to see etc.). The appartment is in a very nice location...cery good to explore the whole city. The whole appartment seems to ve airbnb, which was never a problem, but shows how airbnb ""changes"" to be business rather then bnb...for picky people like us the appartment could have been cleaner and the towels could have been newer...Overall all was fine, especially keeping in mind that we were in a capital city in Italy."
53322,51034389,2015-10-17,43612856,Mia,"Hi Tommy :)
We liked the appartment, the design, and the general arrangement of the living area. It was our first experience with private appartment rent in travel, but in hole, i think it was sucsessful."
53322,51576610,2015-10-21,46021312,Laurent,"As expected, and as seen on the pictures. Location is fantastic, walking distance from many places, and in the middle of a nice area. 
Communication easy and responsive, including reservation of airport transfer. Several contacts (employees: this is not a private person renting his flat, but a company who owns the whole building and professionally rents flats).
Sunny in the afternoon, open the windows and listen to the city and its church bells!
Equipment: kitchen towel and proper sponge should be provided as well as basic cleaning equipment (for longer stay).
Apparemment is on the 3rd floor, with steep staircase: good physical condition required.
The street is more calm than any other (no through traffic), yet it's Rome, pavement, people speaking loudly in the street and windows are very thin: bring your ear plugs if you may need those."
53322,52868034,2015-11-02,930043,Lauren,"We had a lovely time in Tommy's apartment! Everything was organised smoothly beforehand - we had a transfer from the airport straight there for 50 euros. Fabio welcomed us and gave us some good tips and directions around Rome (just in case you didn't know like us - there is a 20 euro surcharge for check-in after 8pm so have this prepared).
The room was everything we needed - neat, clean, comfortable bed, little kitchenette, good shower. We were very comfortable there and we liked the two big windows with a view on to the narrow street.
Rome itself was wonderful but what we liked about this apartment was the location. It was literally a few mins from the market in Campo de Fiori and we walked to all the major attractions. It is also handy and close to Trastevere which has a great nightlife/restaurants. The location meant you could pop back home easily for a quick rest before heading out again.
The apartment was on a quiet street (although if you really like to sleep in and are visiting really soon maybe check if the building works opposite have finished yet because whilst we were there drilling started from before 7am every morning except for sunday). But this is not the apartment's fault and usually it would be quiet as the street is mainly residential.
We were really happy with our choice of accommodation, it couldn't have been more perfect for our needs. And now we are super healthy from walking up all the stairs!!! :)
Thanks again, we would definitely book this place if we return!"
53322,54182285,2015-11-16,2610230,E,"The stay was all you expect from an Airbnb experience. Tommy was welcoming, thoughtful, the place was idealy located at the heart of the city.
I will definitely come back"
53322,58410294,2016-01-02,8856744,Mario,"Tommy's place is very well located, with easy access to Rome's major tourist sites as well as restaurants, bars, and other amenities.  Fabio (who works with Tommy) greeted us at the apartment and was very helpful in terms of recommendations and explaining everything about the apartment.  The apartment itself is cozy (would not recommend for more than 2 people), but otherwise it is comfortable and has everything you would need for your stay in Rome.  Overall, I would recommend Tommy's apartment and would stay with them again."
53322,63124343,2016-02-20,58356181,Rodrigo,"Tomaso was a great host! Very nice, informative of things around town to do, most helpful about all things and very welcoming. Next time in Rome, I'm definitely contacting Tommy again! :)"
53322,69550450,2016-04-11,28581931,Diana,"This Airbnb was great! The perfect size for two people, this apartment is on the top floor in a very central neighborhood so it is easy to get around the city. Fabio met us at the apartment at gave us a tour of the space, as well as a map where he recommended things to do, see, and places to eat! The bed is very comfortable and the room gets a lot of sunlight during the day. This listing is great for short or long stays in Rome."
53322,77766227,2016-06-03,15490188,John,"We arrived in Roma via Roma Termini train station, where we got a 3-day Roma Pass at a kiosk in the corner of the station entrance with the bus stops.  The bus was about 10-minutes and then a 5-minute walk to the apartment, where Tom was already waiting to show us the place.  Check-in went very smoothly.

This location is central to all the busses you'll need.  We were never more than 15-minutes walk or bus from all of our destinations, and never needed a taxi except to get to the airport.  

This apartment is very cozy, a great space for two people.  The AC, fridge, and stove all worked well and the bed was very comfortable. The WiFi was practically non-working and is publicly accessible (insecure) by anyone within range.  This really needs to be fixed because we needed to lookup tours and (Hidden by Airbnb) maps, but I had to use my expensive cell phone roaming data to get basic details about our tours because the WiFi probably has a hundred people using it for free.

The bathroom is in bad shape, having many issues.  The biggest issue started with our first shower.  We realized that the shower drain was clogged and so ended up standing in 3 inches of mirky water.  It was super gross!  Luckily Tom had a worker arrive the very next day, but communication about the worker wasn't very clear.  The worker ended up coming some time the following afternoon while we were away, and when we came back, upon opening the apartment door we were met with a terrible smell of sewer gas.  We opened the windows and vented the gas, but it was very gross.  The worker had left the shower floor a total mess, but at least it was fixed.  The sink also lacks a stopper, which meant that we needed to keep the bathroom door closed to prevent the smell of additional sewer gas.  I think these problems will be addressed, so maybe ask Tom about this before booking.   I wouldn't let these problems detract from your booking, but I do wish they had thoroughly checked the condition of their unit before our arrival.  Overall our stay was not ruined but also was not good.

There is a delicious bakery around the corner called Antico Forno Roscioli and the best pizza of your life at piazza Campo de' Fiori called Forno.  There is also an expensive farmers market there during the day that might be a convenient spot to get gifts for family or friends back home.  The neighborhood felt very safe, it was quiet at night."
53322,78459359,2016-06-06,66127278,Jennifer + Neil,"Tom helped us start the trip off right by arranging a no-hassle car service in from the airport to the front door of the apartment, in the heart of Pompei's Theatre. The location was fantastic, and we were met by Fabio, who gave us the keys and some recommendations on where to dine. Fabio was wonderful - he was charming, helped with the bags, and his recommendations (DanEl restaurant especially) didn't disappoint.  The unit was airy, clean, bight and well maintained, outfitted with everything necessary to recharge after a day of sightseeing. The kitchen and bathroom were clean and functional, and it was great to have laundry in the unit to get some clothes done... just make sure to ask Fabio how to use it as there are no english instructions.  If you don't want to spend time lounging around the unit (and you're in Rome, so why would you), it's the perfect base of operations for exploring all that Rome has to offer.  There's a luggage storage service ~20-feet from the door of the unit, so if you arrive early or want to check out but hang around, it's easy to do. AND, there is a simply fantastic bakery just around the corner (Rosciolios) that is open early with a huge selection of fresh baked goods."
53322,80508968,2016-06-18,63132919,Freya,"Tommy's apartment was in a great location in the heart of Rome, within walking distance of everything. Fabio showed us round and gave us some good tips but communication was an issue at times. "
53322,83938455,2016-07-04,9130642,M D,"The unit is exactly as described and made for a perfect place to stay inside the historic center. Tom was a gracious host and made sure we were all set up prior to arrival as well as checking in on us while there. We would definitely chose this unit again if given the chance. Centrally located, very bright and sunny, clean and well laid out, and a more personal feel than you'd get from a hotel or b & b."
53322,84574860,2016-07-08,66817261,Min,"We stayed here for 3 days.

Pros:
- Very good location. Walkable to all the major sites. Fantastic restaurants near by.
-well-working AC
-clean
-comfortable foam bed
-nice views from the windows.
- Tom was kind enough to book our transport from the apartment to the airport.


Cons:
-It's not fully equipped kitchen. The electric stove took forever to boil, and the second burner did't work, so we were able to cook only one thing at a time
-the apartment is located on the 3rd European floors without elevator. The stairs are short, but it would be difficult walk
up with loads of luggages.
-Because of the restaurant in the front of the building, the noise level is high by delivery truck early in the morning (FYI for light sleepers)
- the laundry isn't very user-friendly we didn't even bother to use it
-lacked toiletries and kitchen essentials
as simple as olive oil
-there was a few open wi-fi, so the whole building uses them, it is slow during the night hours.
- Tom is a very nice guy when we met him, but his communication was very poor.
Took long time for him to respond. 

Despite some cons, overall
our stay was pretty decent."
53322,90708752,2016-08-02,6463098,TC Elif,"Tom is a great guy in general. Very helpfull, full of advise and smiley all the time.
The apartment was great perfect location. We had a bad luck with the air conditioner o our actual booking but Tom gave us another apartment right across from that one right away. All in all it was great surely would go back:)"
53322,92977861,2016-08-10,12084291,Thomas,"Notre sÃ©jour nous a pleinement satisfait.
Tout d'abord l'accueil a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s bien, ainsi que la communication avec notre hÃ´te mÃªme si nous n'avons jamais rencontrÃ© le propriÃ©taire, sa partenaire a Ã©tÃ© parfaite. Elle a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©active durant le sÃ©jour. Le propriÃ©taire a Ã©galement pris le temps Ã  mi sÃ©jour de prendre des nouvelles ce qui est sympa.

Concernant l'appartement, beaucoup de positif.
Comme prÃ©vu, l'emplacement est idÃ©al ! La rue est calme et permet de tout faire Ã  pied avec quand mÃªme une bonne dose de courage. Nous avons fait une quinzaine de km par jour sur 5j. Donc je conseille cette emplacement pour ceux Ã  qui Ã§a ne fait pas peur de ne pas prendre de transport en commun. L'appartement en lui mÃªme est agrÃ©able. Wifi, air conditionnÃ©, literie trÃ¨s correcte, etc sont au rendez vous. 
Concernant les dÃ©fauts , il y en a peu mais il faut les mentionner quand mÃªme . Il n'y a aucun rangement or nous Ã©tions Ã  Rome pour 5j ce qui est un peu dÃ©rangeant. De mÃªme pour la salle de bain qui n'est pas trÃ¨s commode mais c'est un studio, on ne peut pas demander la lune non plus.
En rÃ©sumÃ© , super accueil et emplacement . TrÃ¨s bien pour un couple jeune dont l'appartement sert principalement de dortoir sympathique que d'un appartement oÃ¹ passer sa journÃ©e .

53322,102992820,2016-09-20,11674027,Kate,"This place is absolutely wonderful. A huge part of that is due to Evelien, who manages the apartments owned by the host. She is very welcoming and so helpful! Almost everything about this place is great, the modern renovation, convenient location, and it's quiet. The only problem was the wifi, it barely worked. If they get that fixed, this place would be perfect!"
53322,104251149,2016-09-25,63361810,Katy,"I can not say more about the location. AMAZING! Absolutely perfect. Within walking distance of all the ""must see"" locations in Rome. Several wonderful bars and cafes along the street, not to mention and fantastic bakery. 

Eveline, an associate of Tom's, who met us at our arrival to the apartment was so helpful. Thankfully she spoke perfect English and was able to give us several tips and tricks around the area. We were so grateful for her assistance. "
53322,106606952,2016-10-07,30181669,Sarah,"This was the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to stay while visiting Rome! Tom gave us a lot of information up front before our arrival and let us know exactly what to do once we arrived in Rome. We gave Tom our approximate time of arrival and once we arrived into the city we just had to call Evelien to let us into the apartment and she was available right away so it was so great to be able to go straight there and drop off our bags. The apartment is just a little larger than the size of an average hotel room. It was very clean and cute. Evelien gave us an overview of the entire apartment and gave us a map of the city. She went over the whole map with us, told us where she suggested we should go and she told us her favorite restaurant to go to which we went to that night and it was amazing! Evelien gave us such a warm welcome to Rome and it was the perfect start to our trip. The location of this apartment was perfect as well. It was walking distance to absolutely everything we did. (We walked to the Vatican, Colosseum, Trastevere, etc.) It is in a very cute area with small shops off the main road so it is quieter than most areas. On the day we checked out, our flight was not for a couple hours so we just walked right across the street to a baggage stow shop and were able to leave our bags there for a couple hours. I cannot recommend this airbnb enough, I feel so lucky to have been able to stay here!"
53322,107578990,2016-10-11,93815391,Olivia,Everything was very clean and in perfect condition. Amazing location- so close to everything! Overall a perfect stay 
53322,109410220,2016-10-21,7200383,Paul,"Great location, we did almost everything by walking except Borghese Gallery and the Vatican by bus that you can also find nearby. The apartment, on the third floor, was clean with fresh towels waiting for us.  The neighborhood has tons of restaurants and bars with a great atmosphere. Tom was very welcoming and friendly."
53322,110459893,2016-10-26,6533868,Alexander,"Me and my wife spent in Tom's apartment 5 nights in October. We booked our accommodation few days before arrival, luckily the apartment was still available. We didn't get any problems in communication with Tom before/during or after our stay at Rome - all our agreements were respected. 
This apartment has perfect location - during 5 days we have never used metro - everything is available by feet, everything! Apartment was clean and fresh once we arrived, it is very cozy inside. For sure during our next trip to Rome we will book this apartment! Thanks Tom and Evelien!"
53322,111852965,2016-11-02,98287532,William,"This was a good apartment in a great location. We stayed for a long weekend and took walks all over the city. Keep in mind that it is three floors up in a building that does not have an elevator (didn't bother us). My only complaints are that there was a curtain rod that kept falling down, and the sliding door to the bathroom was poorly built."
53322,112727857,2016-11-07,100371172,Naama,"nice apartment. the host is super nice and helpful. the issues I had is the apartment is very small, 4th floor with no elevator and you can hear everything from the street."
53322,114979512,2016-11-21,560289,Vivek,"Tom's place is centrally located - you're close to Campo de Fiori for lively snacks and drinks, from hookah bars to old-school enotecas, and you might just stumble across any number of ruins (including the Pantheon!) on a short wander in the neighborhood. Great location, really efficient, punctual, and responsive hosts, and was perfect for two people for our short stay in Rome! Grazi Tom & Evelien! "
53322,131881550,2017-02-14,49355915,Christos,"The appartment is very good if you want to explore Rome by foot. Very near to Campo de fiori, Pantheon etc. so thats the biggest plus for this apt. We stayed there for 3 nights, had a bit of an issue with the bed which wasnt made up at our arrival and in the bathroom the sink was leaking and the shower didnt have enough warm water for both. The problem with the bed was fixed the same day. But overall the appartment looks nice with some nice details, the location is also nice. Although you hear nearly everything that happens outside the window due to poor isolation, but if you are tired in the evening you anyway fall asleep very quick. "
53322,135124789,2017-03-03,2804852,Annie,"This apartment was in a great location, and we could walk everywhere from here. The check in process was really easy, and we even worked with Tom to arrange a ride to and from the airport.  I would definitely stay here again!"
53322,142772935,2017-04-09,8733381,Amandine,"The best is the location of the appartment, which is walking distance from most sites and if you are a bit tired there are plenty of buses passing nearby as well. The apartment was also very practical with all what you need and cosy. We recommend :-)"
53322,143703725,2017-04-13,23059508,Mathilde,"Very good location !
Nice and clean place 
"
53322,148972563,2017-05-02,3181999,Nikolaus,"Tom is a great host and couldn't be more helpful for all the things the see around. Location ist great, you get all the good things of the traditional Roscioli food chain just 2 mins around you. And Campo di Fiori. And Piazza Navona. And Trastevere. And and and. The room is the size of a mid-sized hotel room, so it looks a bit more spacious on the photos. When you get home late, the occasional motorini swooshing by really dont bother, the street is in a quiet corner. Bit of a downer were the short hot shower (>5min) and the occasional malfunction of wifi, but hey, petty flaws compared to the magnificence of the city. Thanks Tom, it was fun, say hi when you are in Berlin. Cheers, Nikolaus and Julia"
53322,151789361,2017-05-14,25338945,Corinne,"A very nice, clean and cozy appartment within walking distance to the most important places of interest. We really enjoyed our stay in the studio and in the centre of Rome. We will definitely come back...
The only things to improve are the internet (a little slow) and the water (which was not enough warm/hot for two quick showers)."
53322,153956605,2017-05-22,44359502,Sara,"Location is perfect- all walking distance! 
Size of the apartment is nice too, perfect for a couple.
Arrival & Departure was easy, constantly in contact with the host and late check out was possible.
The only negative point was the Wifi- throughout our stay we had terrible connection which was very frustrating at times. 
"
53322,156550898,2017-05-31,7900317,Arnauld,"We had a great stay at Tom's apartment. In total we stayed for 6 nights. Especially the communication with Evelien was great! The apartment is very well situated, at walking distance to all main places of interest. Thanks to Tom and Evelien for housing us, it was a fantastic stay! We can absolutely recommend Tom's accommodation."
53322,159518531,2017-06-11,107686000,Evelyne,"Le logement est confortable, trÃ¨s bien situÃ© au centre de Rome et l'accueil pris en charge par Evelein a Ã©tÃ© parfait. Elle s'est aussi occupÃ©e du transfert de l'aÃ©roport pour notre arrivÃ©e et notre dÃ©part. Nous recommandons ce logement qui permet de dÃ©couvrir Rome Ã  pied."
53322,170883176,2017-07-16,110335341,Romain,Good location

Je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de voir Tom mais il a Ã©tÃ© disponible par sms.
L'appartement est idÃ©alement situÃ©. Il manque juste quelques rangements ,bien utile lorsque l'on reste plusieurs jours.
IdÃ©al pour un week end a Rome!"
53322,180060430,2017-08-09,141570132,Heidi,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it was perfect for a couple. It is very clean and well decorated. It is a small, cozy studio - as the photo suggests. The location is perfect for walking to the Vatican, the colosseum, Trevi fountain and Spanish steps. We didn't have to take any public transit. The bed was comfortable. The water was only hot however for a two-minute shower. We would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to see the main sights in Rome. We loved being so close to Campo di fiori and the area of trastevere was a short walk across the bridge for a younger, livelier crowd with many restaurants. Thank you Evelien for suggesting these places."
53322,186642627,2017-08-25,89728766,Andre,very well located. Clean and calm building. Possible to access main attractions walking.
53322,189051491,2017-08-31,25399803,Sylvie,"Le Studio est parfaitement bien placÃ© pour visiter Rome Ã  pieds. Il nous a permis de nous reposer aprÃ¨s nos journÃ©es de dÃ©couvertes. Le studio est en retrait du bruit et est climatisÃ© ce qui est un vrai plus pour affronter les fortes chaleurs. 
Nous avons Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s bien accueillis et Evelien s'est montrÃ©e disponible avant mais aussi pendant notre sÃ©jour. Un grand merci!"
53322,192797165,2017-09-11,21051315,Nadia,"L'emplacement est parfait, proche de tous les monuments incontournables Ã  pied , joli studio idÃ©al pour un couple et situÃ© au 3Ã¨me Etage sans ascenseur .propretÃ© impeccable. Par contre quelques dÃ©fauts Ã  noter: L'eau chaude de la douche ne marche pas trÃ¨s bien, assez bruyant dans la rue pendant la nuit lors de notre sÃ©jour.
Nous n'avons pas rencontrÃ© Tom mais Evelien nous a bien accueilli et prÃ©sentÃ© la ville et les bons plans, Tom Ã©tait disponible  quand nÃ©cessaire."
53322,194502670,2017-09-17,7875868,Edelweiss,"We had a great time staying at Tom's place. The location was great. It was in the center of everything. We were able to walk to the major tourist attraction within 25 mins or less. Evelien was great to work with. She was very easy to communicate with. Our flight was delayed and she knew we were going to be late. She was very understandable. I would highly recommend booking a transfer with them. For 50 euros, it was definitely worth it."
53322,197408511,2017-09-25,3528343,Maja Brita,"The room was ok, with some room for improvement. Location is very good. Central to the major sites and for going out at night. If we come back to Rome, though, I'll rather spend some more euros on a hotel. Evelien is very sweet and informative."
53322,199069046,2017-10-01,14809215,Lamisse,"I'll start off with the positives... the location was pretty much perfect for my husband and I's recent stay in Rome. It was close to all the main sites/ areas (and steps away from the most delicious bakery!). The A/C worked well and was appreciated. 
Now on to the not-so-great:
- Communication with Tom was difficult and confusing (his first time replying was the night before our check-in and we were researching alternative places to stay because it seemed like he was going to cancel). When he did communicate, he kept insisting we move our messages to (Hidden by Airbnb) rather than AirBnB which made us suspicious/ uncomfortable. He was over 20mins late for our check-in (even though he was in the building) which made us anxious and asking neighbours in the area for help contacting him.
- The WiFi was TERRIBLE. It's shared with the whole building (I'm guessing to cut costs..) and I wasn't able to upload/ send any photos or do an online check-in for our flight
- The shower was TERRIBLE. Hot water only lasted 2 minutes max. 
- The amenities were EXTREMELY sparse. We don't expect much but if running AirBnBs is your full-time gig, I would expect at least some common essentials such as hand soap, a tissue box, a kettle, detergent for the washing machine (even though I specifically asked Tom for some on our first day), etc.
The washing machine was one of the reasons we chose this apartment since we were traveling light but we ended up having to use a laundromat instead.

We may have overlooked some of the points above if it was more affordable but for the price of the apartment, we could have stayed in other Airbnbs or hotels in the same area.

We have stayed in dozens of AirBnBs around the world (and around Italy) and I have to say this was our worst experience yet."
53322,201826405,2017-10-09,46711364,Jeff,"Tom's is nice, everything you need, great location. We had an issue with the washer and he addressed it right away. He is a nice guy and would love to stay with him again!"
53322,213272170,2017-11-20,33650512,Pascal,"Superbe emplacement dans Rome, literie parfaite! MalgrÃ© un petit souci d'eau chaude le 1er jour vite rÃ©glÃ© par Evelein, et un rideau rÃ©calcitrant, excellent endroit pour profiter de Rome au bas des escaliers... Grazie mille!"
53322,238883498,2018-02-27,17422264,Romain,"Tom is a lovely host, well traveled and local at the same time: a Glocalist! - he will give you a treasure of good tips for things to do, see and eat around in Rome.

The studio is really, really nicely located walking distance of basically everything.

The place is a very good value and decoration very stylish. 

I do recommend it for a romantic 'Glocal' week-end :)"
53322,242514227,2018-03-12,55127243,BÃ©nÃ©dicte,Tom est trÃ¨s sympa et aidant. L'appartement trÃ¨s beau et bien situÃ©
53322,244730424,2018-03-19,9333603,Hubertus,"Absolutely great place, with an outstanding host. We stayed for a weekend and used the apartment to explore Rome. Perfect location to reach all important points within walking distance. 
Tim gave us a very warm welcome and even had a special map with recommendations and spots, you don't find in usual guide books.

The room was very clean, with all basics provided. I have read comments about the hot water shower, but wouldn't see this an issue. We both took a shower in the morning and didn't had to use cold water.

I'll definitely book that place again !

PS: use the transport from the airport, that was a really good service and less stressful than taxis."
53322,246369317,2018-03-25,15168378,Steph,"Fantastic location, very easy to walk everywhere. Still quiet enough to relax. Great restaurants, and Giova gave some fabulous recommendations. Would happily return!"
53322,250746542,2018-04-06,11967845,Suzanne,"Tom's place is great for a short trip to Rome!  Conveniently located on a quiet street, just behind the bustling Campo di Fiori, it was a perfect place to unwind after a long day of roaming the streets of Rome and the perfect central location to see all the sights.  There is a small passageway from Via Grotta Pinta directly into Campo di Fiori, but be aware that it closes at night - so you just have to walk around the block (only a few more steps) to get back to the apartment.  The location is great for walking to all the sights- very close to Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Castle St. Angelo, The Vatican and even the Roman Forums - although, I am very accustomed to walking a lot since I live in NYC.  There are plenty of great restaurants, bars and shops nearby - including a small grocery for the basics.  Tom and Giovanni were always available and gave some great tips for our stay.  I would highly recommend utilizing their offer for an airport transfer - I used it to and from the airport and it was fantastic.  It was nice to come off the plane and have a car waiting to take me right into the city without hassle!  I will definitely be contacting them again for my next trip to the Eternal City :-)"
53322,256074067,2018-04-22,15624350,Kurtis,Check in was a breeze. Great place for a few our few nights in Rome! Tom helped us schedule a private car from the airport which made arrival easy and convenient. Would definitely recommend for a single or couple to see all the sites of the city
53322,257780506,2018-04-27,13703982,Giada,BRAVO !!
53322,261238648,2018-05-06,10213986,Selena,"Toms place is in a great location right in the heart of Rome. Typical of some Roman apartments- Itâs up three flights of stairs and thereâs no lift available. It wasnât an issue for us, but I could see how this would be difficult for anyone less agile.  The hot water only lasted about 5 mins, and this was an issue when two people wanted to shower at the same time of day. There was a washing machine for clothes, however this was broken. The owner was able to set up a private transfer from the airport and also left a guidebook of suggestions around town which was helpful. WiFi was strong throughout our 4 days there. Communication with the host was easy."
53322,267579283,2018-05-22,11321309,Lisa,"The apartment was a great city pad, in a convenient area close to all the sights and good restaurants. The apartment was well kitted out, comfy and enough space for a short stay in Rome. Giovanni was very helpful in organising us a transfer, recommending local places to eat and giving us some tips on the area"
53322,271376055,2018-06-01,129509671,Ron,"There are pluses and minuses on this apartment. The location is very good - close to attractions and transit routes. The size of the unit is smaller than the impression the pictures give (but still manageable if you are not a large person(s)).  Giovanni is the ""greeter"" on Tom's behalf and he is terrific - a very welcoming, lovely guy and he took care of a repair issue quickly (shower drain was plugged and filled up like a pool).  Hot water tank only holds 15 litres so take short showers if there are two of you.  We liked the large windows for light. Take earplugs as you are in the city centre. The washing machine that was listed as a feature of the apartment was not working and there was no mention of taking care of it so don't plan on that convenience.  When we requested arrival directions, the host gave ""advice"" that it would be best to have him arrange a private transfer from the airport to the apartment. We felt transit would be a no-brainer with the apartment right in the centre of Rome and indeed it was. Not sure why public transit is discouraged by the host - we found that unusual and misleading.  Another smaller, but unsettling, detail is that there is no apparent fire escape route information posted anywhere and we were on the fourth floor with only one central, very narrow stairwell option to exit - rules in Rome must be different. In summary, this was a convenient and affordable option - just be aware what you are getting."
53322,272794557,2018-06-04,17259119,Chris,"The room was not clean when we arrived. 
There were ants in the kitchen. 
The wifi was so weak it was useless. 
We ran out of toilet paper. 
The hot water lasted less that 2 minutes in the shower."
53322,279636278,2018-06-21,12088068,Sara,Thanks Tom and Giova for a warm welcome and for always being very responsive. We enjoyed our stay and the apartment was in a great location for exploring everything.
53322,303333383,2018-08-07,76097291,BenoÃ®t,"Nous avons passÃ© un trÃ¨s agrÃ©able sÃ©jour Ã  Rome dans ce logement.
Selon nous les points forts sont le magnifique accueil de Giovanni et la localisation qui est parfaite pour dÃ©couvrir Rome. En effet l'appartement est proche de la plupart des monuments et si besoin un arrÃªt de bus est Ã  proximitÃ©.
Le tunnel menant Ã  Campo de' Fiori est trÃ¨s pratique Ã©galement.
Tous les Ã©quipements sont prÃ©sents, et l'air conditionnÃ© est agrÃ©able lors des chaudes journÃ©es estivales.
Ensuite, contrairement Ã  certains commentaires que nous avons pu lire, le studio est parfait pour deux personnes.
Pour conclure nous remercions Ã©normÃ©ment Giovanni et Tom pour ce sÃ©jour et nous espÃ©rons revenir au plus vite !

La literie est bonne et la cuisine fonctionnelle. Petit bÃ©mol, nous avons eu des fourmis rouges pendant notre sÃ©jour, un problÃ¨me qui sera sans doute rÃ©glÃ© dâici peu : les hÃ´tes (en lâoccurrence, Giovanni) sont tout Ã  fait disponibles et trÃ¨s arrangeants.

53322,313218751,2018-08-25,26313606,Lisa,"The Appartement is very clean and right in the central of Rome.
You can walk to the piazza di fiori,pantheon,Piazza Navona and Trastevere. Giovanni helped us with loaaads of tips for dinner and breakfast and therefore we could enjoy some real Italian food - far away from the tourist spots.


We definitely would come back!"
53322,318702773,2018-09-04,32004451,Annie,Tomâs place was great. Awesome location right in the center of the city and convenient to walk everywhere. Communication was wonderful and Giovanni was great to meet and help us check in. Only couple of issues we had was with the shower and the air conditioning. It has been warm in Rome and the AC just wasnât cooling down the room. In the evening we tried to open the windows and for some reason just was very hot and extremely loud outside on the street with the windows open. The shower also wasnât great. Just know if you expect to shower for more than a couple minutes itâs not ideal the hot water runs out. We had to switch off when to shower so we both could at least attempt to get some warm water. Other than that itâs a small place perfect for a couple of days for a couple people but definitely wouldnât be able to accommodate more than that. Thanks for hospitality!
53322,323204530,2018-09-15,77551045,Erin,"We loved this airbnb, and would happily stay here again! A few things that stood out:
1) The location was perfect -- right in the middle of everything, yet NOT in a touristy area. Basically our ideal location.
2) They gave great recommendations for local spots in the neighborhood, and we loved every place we tried - a tiny wine bar, a bakery, a market, etc.
3) They were SUPER responsive, within minutes, any time we emailed them. Very helpful!

I recommend this spot 100%, and would definitely stay here again. A few small things to note:
1) There are 3 flights of stairs to get inside. It didn't bother us, and wouldn't personally deter me from staying here, but 3 flights aren't for everyone.
2) The hot water heater is on the smaller side - don't expect to stand in the shower for a long time or take a lot of showers right back to back. Not a big issue, either, but worth noting.

Thanks Tom!"
53322,328446138,2018-09-26,51424643,Jason,"PERFECT LOCATION!!!  You can walk to every special location from the apartment.

53322,333398399,2018-10-07,16836112,Kari,"Perfect location! My best friend and I stayed here, and it was perfect for us. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the street in front of the apartment is quiet during the night for a good nightâs sleep. (A very important factor, after adventuring all day...and a rarity in a place so close to the Campo.) :) The flat was within easy walking distance to all of our favorite places in the city, and communication prior to check in (with Gio and Tom) was straightforward and easy. Tom is sweet, fun, welcoming, engaging, kind and is highly knowledgeable on the great spots in Rome. We had a wonderful stay!"

We got some recommendations from Tom before we got there. The location is excellent as it's so easy to walk everywhere. When the wifi stopped working Tom came to fix it very quickly and when we had checked out and I realised I forgot my jacket after shutting the door behind us, Tom was there within 5 mins to let me back in to get it before we went to the airport. Overall we were happy with the apartment."

Piccolo problema ma non tanto importante: l'acqua calda per la doccia. Per il resto, era perfetto! :)"

53322,432253203,2019-04-03,139226703,JÃ©rÃ©my,"Rien Ã  redire sur l'appartement de Tom, le gros point fort reste la localisation qui permet de voir toutes les grandes attraction de Rome sans prendre le moindre transport (les piazza du centre historique sont Ã  15-20min grand maximum, et les attractions plus lointaines comme le colisÃ©e sont Ã  30min). Le quartier de campo di fiori est idÃ©al pour sortir tout en Ã©tant proche du logement.

De plus, Tom et Giovanni sont trÃ¨s arrangeant pour la garde des bagages et pour les horaires d'arrivÃ©e et de dÃ©part.
Tom propose aussi un service de transfert entre le logement et l'aÃ©roport, ce qui permet d'Ã©conomiser beaucoup de temps sans dÃ©penser beaucoup plus.

Bref, une adresse que nous conseillons vivement !"
53322,433855736,2019-04-07,113087499,Mathieu,Une excellente adresse pour visiter Rome ( la plupart des monuments Ã  - de 20min de marche) et un hÃ´te trÃ¨s accueillant. Lâappartement collÃ© parfaitement Ã  lâannonce.
53322,436528904,2019-04-13,253142910,Alyson,"Host was really nice and helpful, he left us a local travel guide of Rome to see things with less tourists! For the apartment, the location is phenomenal but the amenities were not the best. Issues with water heater and the washer but host fixed them on the last day."

Both Tom and Giovanni were very responsive. Would recommend the location and place."

Thanks Tom"

Appartement bruyant la nuit (rue trÃ¨s passante), propretÃ© de la salle de bain limite, manque dâÃ©quipements et dâattentions (juste 1 grande serviette et 1 petite par personne pour les 5 jours, 2 rouleaux de PQ, pas de boissons ou autre, pas de placards de rangement).
Le logement est trÃ¨s bien placÃ©, Ã  2 pas des principaux lieux touristiques. IdÃ©al pour 2 ou 3 jours grand max.
De plus, la porte du logement a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©calcitrante Ã  2 reprises, nous ne pouvions plus ouvrir : Tom sâest montrÃ© trÃ¨s rÃ©actif et a pu rÃ©parer pendant notre journÃ©e visite."

53322,557537714,2019-11-01,165023661,Victor,L'appartement est parfait et correspond tout Ã  fait aux photos. Il est largement assez grand pour deux personnes et il est trÃ¨s fonctionnel. Il est Ã©galement trÃ¨s bien placÃ©. C'Ã©tait notre premiÃ¨re fois Ã  Rome et nous avons dÃ©couvert que les transports (exceptÃ©s les bus) dÃ©servent trÃ¨s mal le centre. Nous avons fait beaucoup de choses Ã  pied et l'emplacement du logement est idÃ©al ! Notez Ã©galement que l'appartement se trouve dans une rue trÃ¨s calme. Je recommande vivement !

He also provided excellent recommendations for eating and drinking! The location is central for all the main attractions, we walked everywhere except to get to the Vatican. The apartment is a nice studio, very comfortable bed! Thanks Tom for a great stay!"
53322,612958659,2020-03-01,168118555,Alfie,"Tommi was impeccable compared to many other places we have stayed at previously with Airbnb. He made me and my girlfriend feel very at home and was always very quick to reply on (Hidden by Airbnb) to any queries or problems we had! 

He makes brochures for his customers with recommendations and the ones we went to were amazing. 

Could not fault Tommi in anyway. A really genuinely nice guy - shows genuine interest and not fake in the slightest. 

Location was amazing, close to everything but the street itself is alittle hidden which made it very nice for the night.

Youâll miss out anywhere else!"

53325,534008,2011-09-15,317871,David,"Tommy was an amazing host! Very friendly and helpful, he even had his mother, who was also a treat, meet us with a bottle of wine at the apartment when he couldn't make it.  There was a slight mix up with which apartment we had reserved initially, but Tommy took care of it as soon as he could and we really enjoyed our stay.  Hot water is in short supply, but everything else worked out perfectly.  The location is as advertised in the center of Rome, not super close to any of the metro stops, but an equal walking distance from all the major sites.  I would definitely return and recommend these apartments to anyone!"
53325,830415,2012-01-03,930811,Liana,"Tommy is the best host I've ever had! He is very responsive, cheerful, helpful, he knows the answers to all the questions - what to see, where to go dinner, shopping and everything you what to know, history, legends, stories, and ready to share it at any moment, 24/7. He is not only a exiting host, but also a cheerful and interesting person. He showed me some of his apartments at  Campo di Fiori to choose from, and all of them are beautiful, cozy, clean and comfortable. And the place is one of the most pleasant in Rome, on a right side of the river, not in touristic area and close to all attractions . Thanks to Tommy I've spent the best days in Rome."
53325,1356428,2012-05-27,2071082,Tommy And Jessica,"Fantastic stay!  Tommy was flexible in meeting us when we weren't sure of our arrival and then later than expected.  He was very kind and recommended some great places, and was always accessible if we needed him.  The Studio Blu was great, cool place in the greatest neighborhood which wasn't completely run over with tourist.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience.  "
53325,1503452,2012-06-18,896812,Svenja,"Tommy is really a great  host! Not only did he welcome me in Rome, but he provided infos about nice places to eat, have a drink etc... He helped wherever he could...
The appartment had a great location, in the middle of everything, yet quiet. Everything was just splendid!"
53325,1685008,2012-07-11,499291,Liv,"I absolutely adored this apartment, it made my whole Rome experience incredible. It was so nice to come home to a clean and comfortable apartment after a day getting lost in Rome.
Tommy - the host was absolutely delightful, he greeted me on arrival as if long lost friends and was always quick to reply to my emails/ texts prior to arrival. The apartment was conveniently located in Campo de Fiori and within walking distance to all major sites. At no stage did I have to get a cab or public transport anywhere. Tommy also left out maps, directions to a few places such as supermarkets and a coffee bar and also provided a restaurant guide and map.
I would definitely stay here again and I would recommend Tommy's apartments to anyone! Thanks Tommy :)"

Location was perfect, we walked everywhere (longest time was about 30 minutes), to all the major sights. Also if you don't want to go far there is great food just around the corner. "
53325,2683120,2012-10-22,3599621,Giselle,this apartment in in the middle of it all. It not very big and the bathroom is no big deal. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room anyways. it is on the 4th floor with no elevator which was not a problem for us but might be for someone else. I was nice overall and in an amazing part of town.

Thanks Tommy, for all the best tips about Rome!!!!!!"
53325,4614086,2013-05-15,5900971,Mila,"The apartment is in a great location. All the popular sites are within a 20-30 min walk at a tourists pace. There are some nice little shops & restaurants around the area & campo di fiori is certainly a much nicer location than many of the other popular choices. The apartment is everything you would need: cosy, clean, quiet, well equipped and ideal for a couple. Studio Blu is on the 4th floor in a building with no lift but this was known at the time of booking. It's just a lot harder than thought, when carrying suitcases up, staggering home after a huge meal or too much to drink! :) Having said that, Tommy is a wonderful host: he was there to meet us  when we arrived & was kind enough to help cart our luggage up. He was also really responsive and provided many great suggestions. I would certainly not hesitate to recommend his place, or him as a host."
53325,4811360,2013-05-27,5018356,Carrington,"This apartment was perfect for our 4-night stay. Right in the middle of Rome, with easy access to EVERYTHING on foot or by bus (no metro stops in the Centro Storico). Every day we walked to all the tourist sights, and every night we wandered around the Campo dei Fiori, Piazza Navona, the Pantheon, the tiny lanes of Ponte, up to the Spanish Steps, across the river to Trastevere, down to the Colosseum ... Tommy is an amazing host, met us on arrival and provided maps and tons of info on sights, restaurants, the neighborhood and getting around. His dinner recommendations were great, and he let us stay as long as we wanted on the last day. Very responsive to emails and calls. Apartment is on the 4th floor (American) up narrow steep stairs, but no different from an NYC walkup. Clean with great amenities (dishes! washing machine! AC! hairdryer!), on a quiet street but you can hear the church bells every hour. Literally everything you need nearby to have an incredible Roman holiday. Overall an A+ Airbnb experience. Grazie mille, Tommy, ciao!"
53325,4920833,2013-06-02,5844764,Igor,"Host meet with me at apartment,explained everything about.Gived list with recommended places,in apartment theres all type of Rome guides.
Apartments in reality smaller than on pictures(good photographer).I think for 2 persons is still okay.
To Vatican is about 20mins walk.All other landmarks is around 10-20 mins also.No need to use public transport. 
If you have much luggage be prepared for workout,3rd floor with small stairs."
53325,4985345,2013-06-05,2146034,Mirjam,"We spent some nights at Tommy's studio during our stay to discover Rome. In a nutshell: We highly recommend it!
The studio is absolutely central. Most of the tourist attractions are within walking distance. The appartment is very clean and offers all you need. We felt comfortable from the very first second. Tommy was very reliable and helpful. Best of all besides the appartment were his recommendations - where to eat great food and what to visit besides of the main tourist spots. This made our stay very special. Thank you Tommy! "
53325,5091459,2013-06-11,6654459,Paul,"Having never stayed in Rome or used airbnb before, I was a little uneasy about booking this room, but upon messaging back and forth with Tommy a few times prior to booking, I felt much better - he was very responsive and answered all of my questions.  He set up a ride from the airport for me (who was on time, easy to find, and helped with my bags), which was reasonably priced so I didn't have to worry about trying to figure out the public transit system when I arrived.  Once I arrived at the apartment, Tommy met me, helped me up the stairs (don't rent this apartment if you are disabled or would have difficulty navigating several flights of stairs), and then not only gave me information about the apartment, the surrounding area, and how to reach him if I had questions, he also took me on a short walking tour of the area and showed me the places he recommended to eat or grab a drink.  Really nice guy who was easy to reach and very responsive if I needed something after he had left me to myself.  The room itself was small by american standards, but absolutely adequate for what I needed.  It was clean, everything worked, and was actually quite comfortable.  Examples:  shower head was broken when I arrived.  It was fixed within a couple hours.  I needed some additional towels - they were delivered same day.  Water was hot, air conditioning worked, and bed was clean and comfortable.  Tommy provided information beyond the basic touristy things to do and interesting facts about the local area that most people would not know.  All in all, a fabulous 4 days in Rome, and I thank Tommy for his part in making it so."
53325,5396156,2013-06-28,5892949,Suzanne,"	My husband and I had a fabulous stay in this apartment and would love to stay there again if we have the opportunity! The location couldn't have been better. We never used a cab or public transportation (besides to and from the airport). We walked everywhere because it was such a central location to all the sites that we wanted to see! It was also just a two minute walk to a supermarket which was really convenient. 
	The actual apartment was small but comfortable and had everything that we needed (refrigerator, small stove, sink, closet, hairdryer, iron, washing machine, etc.). It was also clean and neat. Though the location is in the heart of so much activity, the apartment was very quiet since it's tucked away on a small street. 
	Tommy was an excellent host. Leading up to our time in Italy, if I had questions, Tommy always promptly responded to my emails. He was unable to meet us on the day of our arrival, so he arranged for his brother, who was also a wonderful host, to meet us. A couple of days into our stay, the internet stopped working. I sent a quick text, and he immediately had someone fix it! The night before our departure Tommy scheduled a cab  to take us to the airport, so we didn't have to worry about contacting someone. I was so impressed with his effort to make sure that we had an excellent stay.   "
53325,5754783,2013-07-15,880861,Autumn,"Tommy's place is awesome.  He even set up a car service to pick us up from the airport.  The location, air conditioner, and other amenities made it better than any hotel or hostel.  I would recommend this place and if we are ever in Rome again we will be looking up his places to stay in. "
53325,5906927,2013-07-22,976505,Todd,"A great little apartment in a perfect location for getting around Rome. It had everything I needed, including the previous air conditioning during a Rome summer, and it was nice and clean upon check-in. Tommy offered to arrange an airport pick-up, but I like to wing it, so I made my way there myself via the train and tram system, which was also fairly straightforward due to the great proximity to a tram stop. We had a bit of a miscommunication on when I would be arriving at the apartment, which led me to sit outside for a bit of time, but Tommy showed up with a cold lemon soda, which made him an instant hero in my book. He also provided some great restaurant recommendations around the area, which made for some nice meals. And, again, the location was outstanding, which cannot be emphasized enough. Everything was walking distance, but when it was extra hot after a long day at Vatican City, it was very convenient to take a bus to a stop nearby the apartment as well. I would definitely stay here at Tommy's place again."

53325,6916753,2013-08-30,7646642,Niko,Everything with this apartment was great. Tommy set up a private transfer for us from the Airport to his apartment. The driver knew exactly where to go and the lady that let us into the apartment was right on time. The apartment itself was great and the wifi was very reliable and strong. I would definitely stay here again. 
53325,7811094,2013-10-04,5416973,Eric,"This studio has insanely good location.  You will not have any trouble walking to everything you want to do.  It also makes it really convenient to wander the streets at night, because it is so close to the center of everything.

The apartment is a great value.  I doubt you could find another place with this location at this price.  Tommy was a great host.  Someone else checked us in, and everything went really smooth, she gave great recommendations, etc.  We ran into Tommy on the way out, and he was super nice and accommodating (he let us checkout pretty late because no one else was coming in that night).

It's not the Ritz Carlton.  Just make sure you aren't expecting that and your trip to Rome will be great.  I'm glad we stayed here, and would definitely consider staying here again if we go back to Rome. "
53325,8238737,2013-10-21,6702099,Carlee,"Perfect location, nothing fancy. Did not provide toilet paper, pick some up before you get there! Off a quiet street, no loud noises while sleeping. Can walk everywhere to the main attractions. I would take his offer from the airport transportation, public transport crowded and dirty!! Had left a map and a lonely planet rome book which both came in handy. Pesci Fritti across the street provided a nice seafood dinner. "
53325,9293635,2013-12-19,5367434,Eytan,"We stayed in Tommy's place - Studio Blu - Campo De Fiori.
The flat is great. nice and well designed. its not big - but just want a couple need in Rome.
The location is perfect' in the hart of Rome but very quiet area  - you can walk to all the main attractions easily.
About Tommy - this is the best part - Tommy is great !!!!  always want to help' very communicative, and he's there for you. 

To my opinion this or any other Tommy's flats are must's to everyone - a good flat from a reliable person !!

Esta en el centro de todo en una tÃ­pica callesita romana. Se puede ir caminando rÃ¡pidamente a todos los sitios de interes. El departamento reune todas las comodidades que esperabamos. Tommy es muy agradable y simpatico. Nuestra llegada accidentada y con retraso, hizo peligrar nuestro ingreso al apartamento. Por otro lado la informacion que nos hizo llegar la pagina no fue del todo clara respecto a la ubicacion del apartamento. Por suerte a Tommy lo conocian en un restaurante que esta frente al edificio y nos facilitaron el contacto con Ã©l. En unos minutos Tommy llegÃ³ y nos dio la bienvenida. "

53325,13077673,2014-05-19,13645171,Florence,"We had a wonderful long weekend in Rome. The flat was not the one pictured on the website, it was different and not as nice, but it was still pleasant and ideally located. The neighbourhood was wonderful, and being central, it enabled us to walk everywhere. Tommy was helpful with good restaurant and shop suggestions. "
53325,13531547,2014-05-30,11050331,Ian,Tommy was waiting in the apartment when we arrived. Easy to communicate with and has great recommendations for local dining and having a great time in Rome. It is quite a hike to get to the apartment (3rd floor location) but he helped carry our luggage which made it easier. He also arranged for car service to the airport that i highly recommend. The apartment is just the right size for 2 people and he had it stocked with the essentials! Great host!!!
53325,13914655,2014-06-08,13852713,Aleksandra,"We didn't have a chance to meet Tommy. Giovanna, who was very nice and kind  met us at arrival. She also organized transfer from the airport that I find very useful. The apartment was ok,  unfortunately it is not the same one that we booked! We were supposed to get Studio Blu that we saw on the photos on the Airbnb site. 

Our apartment was spacious, we had all that we needed, a small kitchen, bathroom, towels, etc, but it was not as nice as Studio Blu. Anyway, I would gladly recommend it.

The appartment is probably smaller and not as new as it seems in the photos, but is OK, we didn't need more. 
The host very accesible and ready to help.
Probably we will repit!!

I had a wonderful stay in Rome and the host was super nice :)"
53325,19422762,2014-09-12,19847312,Chris,"This flat was perfect for our stay in Rome!  Tommy was very responsive pre-arrival and Fabio was a fantastic host once we were in Rome.  Fabio was waiting to greet us, recommend delicious restaurants/fun activities and even set up a private car for our return trip to the airport.  The neighborhood was amazing and all of the things we enjoyed most during our trip happened within steps of the front door.  You are right in the middle of all the action and get a great feel for the local and tourist lifestyles.  We could not have been happier with our stay and look forward to returning sometime soon!  Thank you for a wonderful trip!"
53325,19868048,2014-09-20,7757525,Jeffrey,We had a great time staying here! The location is incredible - very close to all of the attractions and the neighborhood has a lot to offer in terms of restaurants and bars. The apartment wasn't quite as new as the photos would have you believe but the place was fine. Highly recommend the private transfer from the airport as it was not much more than a cab but very convenient.
53325,21708641,2014-10-22,21276462,Maria,"Location: Perfect
Apartment: Nice and clean and lived up to the description, but needs a coffeemaker.
Tommy: We didn't meet, he was on vacation. But we were so fortunate to meet Fabio instead. He was nice, helpful and introduced us to Rome the Roman way. He really made a difference, because he understood our needs and wishes for our trip to Rome.
We can only give our best recommendations for the apartments in this location, and for Fabio as a gentleman who knows the city and is willing to help make your stay as pleasant as possible. He almost convinced us to stay a year.
We will definitely come back!!!
Best wishes,
Janni & Maria"
53325,22373979,2014-11-04,21242049,Alan,The flat was very comfortable and in a great location.  You could walk to all major destinations in under 20 minutes.

El apartamento es pequeÃ±o, pero no importa ya que si visitas Roma en el apartamento estÃ¡s muy poco tiempo. AÃºn asÃ­, estÃ¡ muy limpio y todo es bastante nuevo.
La ubicaciÃ³n si es importante y este apartamento estÃ¡ perfectamente ubicado. Puedes ir a pie a casi todos sitios (nosotros lo hicimos) y sino, cerca pasan varios autobuses o tranvÃ­as que te pueden ayudar a ir a cualquier parte muy rÃ¡pidamente.

Excelente, lo recomiendo a los visitantes."
53325,27024083,2015-02-23,13707027,MarÃ­a,"Tommy is a great host, he organized the private transportation from the airport to the apartment and when we arrived he let us choose between two apartments (Studio BLU and a Duplex) for the same price! We finally decided for the duplex and it was an incredible experience! The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Very pretty too. Probably, the best thing was the location, we went walking everywhere and there are many restaurants and shops near the house. I deeply recommend you this place. We will definitely repeat!"
53325,29044986,2015-04-03,25455549,Dawn,"Tommy was a superb host! We took the private transfer arranged by him and he was at the apartment to greet us. Brought us to a nice little cafe for welcome coffee - a gesture much appreciated since my husband and I were both jet lagged. 

The apartment is clean and located in a very convenient location. We could walk to all the major places of attraction. It 

Tommy was very hospitable and we really appreciate his kindness during our stay.

What I loved best was how central and yet very quiet. I can highly recommend it.
Tommaso supplied interesting information on where to eat and what to do. Next time in Rome I will gladly stay at his place again."

Il nous attendait Ã  notre arrivÃ©e Ã  l'appartement et nous a donnÃ© pleins d'indications sur ce qu'il y avait Ã  proximitÃ©. "
53325,34940056,2015-06-14,29077943,John,Great location and perfect apartment. Lift from airport was really handy and tommy was great in arranging a change in pick up area. Tommy responds to emails very promptly.

53325,36797485,2015-07-01,31899434,Steve,A lovely well kept apartment extremely convenient for all the important sights. Tommy was very helpful. The place is not enormous but that is not really a problem since the location means visitors would always be busy!
53325,38418023,2015-07-15,36223807,Christine,"Nous avons sÃ©journÃ© dans un des studios de Tommy et avons passÃ©s un merveilleux sÃ©jour Ã  Rome. Tommy est trÃ¨s accueillant et se rend disponible Ã  la moindre demande. Le studio est trÃ¨s bien situÃ©, trÃ¨s propre et bien Ã©quipÃ©. Tous les endroits touristiques sont accessibles Ã  pied depuis le studio et comble du bonheur aprÃ¨s de longues journÃ©es de marche trÃ¨s ensoleillÃ©es, l'appartement est climatisÃ©.
Nous recommandons cette adresse idÃ©alement situÃ©e."
53325,38756343,2015-07-18,37077285,Ken,"Tommy was a great host, always providing assistance on restaurants and fun things to do from a local's perspective. The apartment is in a great location, walk-able to virtually all tourist spots including Colosseum, Vatican, and Spanish Steps. Air conditioning works great. "
53325,39979132,2015-07-27,37174820,Michael,Tommy was great!!! He arranged everything and our stay was awesome and seamless. The flat was as advertised and literally in the middle of everything. You can walk to everything in Rome! Definitely highly recommend Tommy and the apartment..Would absolutely stay there again.
53325,41234385,2015-08-05,37350345,Juan,"Se trata de un apartamento pequeÃ±o pero completo. Bien cuidado y muy cÃ³modo. Lo mejor: en el centro de Roma. Tienes el Vaticano a 20 minutos, Navona a 5 minutos, Campo di Fiori a 3 minutos, Piazza Venezia a 15 minutos, el Coliseo a 35 minutos, Trastevere a 15 minutos... y paseando se disfruta cada uno de esos paseos. Nos atendiÃ³ Fabio, muy agradable y atento."
53325,42159709,2015-08-11,37332632,Christine,"The host was a nice guy but I have to be honest and admit that the other reviews did not accurately represent this place and neither do the photos. I feel it was over priced, cramped for us two and I didn't appreciate paying extra to stow my bags on the last day which was ridiculous with how much I paid to stay there. Sorry to be blunt but it's the truth. "
53325,42877642,2015-08-16,23832161,June,"Fabio was a great host. Unit was in a quiet location, next to Campo De Fiori and a <10 minute walk from Trastevere. 

Place was smaller than the photos shown, but adequate for two people. Keep in mind the apartment was situated on the third floor which took about 50 steps to get to. Just a heads up for those who may be travelling with larger bags. We found this out the hard way. Admittedly, there were a few issues with the apartment during our stay but nothing that made it unbearable.

All in all, an okay stay given the price."
53325,46713873,2015-09-13,37530802,Aaron,Fabio (our check in host) was fantastic! He gave us a travel map and spent lots of time explaining where to go and places to eat around Rome. He even organised a private driver on our way back to airport for us. Tommy was also a great host being very responsive and organised a private driver from the airport to the apartment. We would definitely recommend this very boutique style studio with loads of character
53325,47465142,2015-09-19,21810504,Lee,"Tommys apartment was perfect for our stay. It fitted 2 of us comfortably, and is clean and tidy as described and shown in the pictures. We had everything we needed for our stay. 
The location could not have been better, everything is walkable within 15-20 mins, and there are also bus stops close by giving easy access if you do not want to walk.
We did not meet Tommy personally, but dealt with Fabio who was great and provided us with a map and some tips and suggestions regarding places to go and getting around etc. He also recommended a small local restaurant 2 mins from the apartment, which we would highly recommend and was some of the best food we ate while in Rome."
53325,48889364,2015-09-29,35773860,Kiana,"My husband and I stayed in this studio for four nights in Rome. We didn't meet Tommy, but we met his colleague Fabio who was very welcoming and helpful, he gave us a map and explained where all the important spots are. Also he arranged us a taxi from the airpot and the way back which was very handy. There is a storage just next to the building which you can leave your luggage on your last day for around â¬9 for the whole day. We found this very convenient as we didn't want to carry our heavy luggage with us on our last day. The location can not be better. We didn't take any bus or train as we could walk to all the interesting places by foot. It was great, because we could go back to the studio after our visits in the morning, take some rest and go out again without wasting any time in the public transport. There are lots of great restaurants around the area also in Trastevere which is only ten minutes walk away.

The flat it self was very clean and tidy and has all the things you need for a short stay. The size is good for two people. The bed is comfortable. Just be aware that you need to take a lot of stairs to get to the top of the building where the studio is which wasn't a problem for us, but might be hard for people who need to take the lift as the building doesn't have one. The only downside of the studio for us was the bathroom that is separated with a glass door from the room, would be better if it had a proper door also the shower it self is not that great and we had problem with the hot water as it would run out very quickly. Other than that we had a great time there and think it worth the money specially because of the location that we loved and the tidiness of the flat."
53325,50173137,2015-10-10,38965253,Ryan,"My fiance and I booked Tommy's room for the first leg of our Italy honeymoon. 

Communication before the trip was a little rough, Tommy set us up to check in with another man named Fabio who wasn't very responsive. We ended up having to wait outside the apartment for Fabio for around two hours until we got a hold of Tommy. Once Tommy found out that Fabio had left us waiting, he rushed to the apartment and was very helpful and apologetic. He gave us a bunch of information about the location, where we should go, and gave us a short tour of the apartment. Tommy was very welcoming, friendly, and helpful once we met him.

The unit itself was pretty nice. Definitely a tiny unit but that's pretty much what we expected. The best part about this listing is its FANTASTIC location. Campo de Fiori is literally a minute walk and there are some great bars/restaurants just around the corner from the unit as well. We walked everywhere from this apartment.

One other thing to note is that this unit was on the 5th or so floor of the apartment so it is a trek to get up there."
53325,51930418,2015-10-25,7363681,Rosemarie,"Tommy was great host once we started communicating thru email and during close to our arrival.  He was responsive and helpful. He has his Co-partner Fabio met with us on our first day at the place but somehow we were disappointed that it wasn't the same picture / room that we saw on the AirB&B website. We would have enjoyed the room more if it is the same interior with wood beam ceilings.  The interior unit was fine and clean.  The shower stall base would mostly get clogged and the drainage was slow during our stay... :(  It needs to be fix. 
We liked most of the upgrades that they did including the bathroom glass sink, faucet and the sliding glass doors.
The location was excellent!!! It is very close to everything including the museums, cafes, groceries, shops, boutiques, Colosseum, Vatican City and much more... Lots of choices for gelato stores.
The Campo dei Fiori is a great place to stay for exploring Rome and hope to visit again next time. We enjoyed our short vacation in Rome and was overwhelmed with so much history in this beautiful city of Italy.

Tommy & Fabio, thank you again for your hospitality.  Appreciate it."
53325,68211713,2016-04-02,4339497,Philippe,"j'ai failli, pour la premiÃ¨re fois, mettre une mauvaise note.
Je mets la moyenne pour deux raisons :
-l'emplacement est de premier ordre
-l'acceuil de julio trÃ¨s pro et trÃ¨s sympa
Cependant, au regard du prix 712 â¬ pour 5 nuits nous nous attendions Ã  beaucoup mieux
-logement tout petit (parait plus grand sur les photos)
-meublÃ© minimaliste et bon marchÃ© (la table est un morceau de contreplaquÃ©
-cuisine minimaliste : deux plaques elec sur un rebord de fenetre, dont une ne fonctionne plus (a quand l'induction ?)
-evier grand comme une assiette
-frigo fonctionne mal fait trop de froid on peux pas le regler
-la douche fonctionne mal et ne tiens pas toute seule
on sent que l'ensemble commence Ã  dater et de petite qualitÃ©.
Ã  60 euros la nuit je n'aurais pas fait de remarque mais au double on s'attend Ã  un minimum de qualitÃ© et de confort"
53325,70613396,2016-04-19,64653644,Juan Carlos,"El apartamento de Tommy es genial para visitar Roma a pie, todo lo importante estÃ¡ cerca, no tuvimos que utilizar el transporte pÃºblico en ninguna ocasiÃ³n. La ciudad es espectacular y el barrio muy tranquilo y con muchas tiendas, bares y restaurantes. Fabio nos ayudÃ³ mucho y nos aconsejÃ³ para quenuestra estancia fuera mÃ¡s cÃ³moda. El apartamento es pequeÃ±o pero suficiente para pasar unos dÃ­as. Lo recomiendo sin duda. "
53325,71576363,2016-04-26,62761761,Juan,Host was really welcoming and gave helpful hints about the city. The location is perfect to do all the touristic activities in the city. The apartment was clean but looked a little bit different from the picture posted online. 
53325,72415082,2016-05-02,5408506,Brent,"Tommy's studio was a great place to stay for a few days in Rome. The location is great as you can walk to just about everything within 15-20 minutes. The studio is comfortably sized and has everything you could need for a short stay, including the washer that we made use of. We didn't meet Tommy but Fabio helped us check-in and gave us some great recommendations. He also scheduled a driver to the airport when we left that made the trip home much easier."
53325,75014921,2016-05-18,27560438,Ian,"Tom's description is accurate: the place is very accessible to all places of interest and historical sights. We managed to visit all the interesting areas on foot. The place, however, is on the 4th floor and located in a building with no elevator. So it takes quite an effort going up and down especially if you're carrying heavy luggage. It is clean and cozy and conducive for sleeping after a long day of walking and sightseeing. I would suggest though that toilet rugs be made available next time to keep the washroom floor dry. Overall, my wife and I enjoyed our stay and won't hesitate to book the place again on our next visit. Thanks, Tom! P.S. Your colleagues, Fabio and Cinzia, were attentive and helpful. Ciao!"
53325,76650716,2016-05-28,64966760,Karen,Fabio's recommendations were great.  Room was clean and exactly as pictured.  There is a converter that we discovered in the dresser drawer that proved to be very convenient.  Awesome central location for walking anywhere.  Surprisingly spacious.  Highly recommend staying here.  Access to public transportation was great.  Price was really good for what we got.  
53325,83308579,2016-07-02,46500925,Rolando,"El anfitriÃ³n coordinÃ³ el taxi desde al aeropuerto al apartamento temprano a la maÃ±ana, pero no nos avisÃ³ que reciÃ©n estarÃ­a libre al mediodÃ­a. Con lo cual tuvimos que pagar un storage y hacer tiempo en la ciudad agotados del viaje. Luego llegÃ³ 20 minutos tarde de lo pactado.
La ducha se inundaba y algÃºn AC goteaba durante la noche molestando el dormir. Tampoco habÃ­a jabÃ³n y shampoo para 4 dÃ­as. Solo para 1. Es la primera vez que tengo una mala experiencia con Airbnb. 3 pisos por escalera tampoco es cÃ³modo. Las fotos ostentaban mÃ¡s de lo que era. Lamentablemente tendrÃ© que leer la letra pequeÃ±a la prÃ³xima vez que alquile algo."

The location of his apartment is perfect, right in the center of Campo de Fiori (walking distance to anywhere we needed to visit) and he owns the entire building. Tommy responded very quickly to any questions we had and wanted to make sure all of his guests were comfortable and had all their needs met. Would definitely highly recommend his apartment to anyone!!"
53325,87237719,2016-07-19,23704833,Joshua,"I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy crash pad in the heart of Rome. Everything you'll want to see is within 30 minutes of walking. 

The apartment was clean and - although small, as shown in the pictures - comfortable for 2. 

I would recommend booking your airport transfer via Tom. A driver was waiting for us with a namecard and it was â¬50 direct to the apartment - where Tom's friend Evelyn was waiting to let us in. 

Thanks again Tom!"

53325,101762453,2016-09-15,1153261,Jeffrey,"Tommy, our host, was incredibly friendly and informational. He greeted us very warmly and gave us some quick tips to start our adventures in Rome. The apartment is located in a fantastic area. When he says you don't  really need to take any public transportation, it's absolutely true. The only time we did was to get to Termini on our way to our next city. "

We were not told about needing to provide a copy of our passports so we were caught off guard when she took pictures of it on her cell phone.

53325,110709070,2016-10-28,5577735,Matthew,Centrally located and an easy walk to all of the sights.
53325,111724136,2016-11-01,21325840,Pilu,"The flat is located in a wonderful neighborhood. It is small but very nice. Maybe a little bit too expensive. Even if the contact Evelien was terrific (answering to our message very soon), we never saw the owner even when we contacted him because of bad odors and cold water. Different from my previous experiences with AirBnB: more like a hotel than a bed and breakfast."
53325,114988482,2016-11-21,4623514,Phyllis,Great location
53325,122838225,2016-12-26,34228702,Patty,"The unit is quaint, a couple streets away from all the action and the daily market at Campo de Fiori.  The shower is small even for European standards, but we could manage for the few days there.  We walked everywhere so easily, with the Spanish Steps being the furthest destination.  Evelin is so sweet and made check-in and check-out a breeze!"

We had a great stay at Tom's apartment. Although we didn't get to meet him personally, our host Evelien did a great job and made sure we felt at home :)
Highly recommend any couple to stay there."
53325,135474841,2017-03-05,446905,Alison,"Lovely apartment in fantastic location - so close to all the key sites of central Rome, everything is within walking distance. Great communication from the host and kindly sorted transfers to and from the airport, as well as giving loads of great tips for our stay. Highly recommended! "
53325,141094886,2017-04-02,434918,Lina,"Stayed for a few days with my husband, and had an overall good stay. We had a few issues with the apartment, mostly with the shower, which Evelien went out of her way to correct. She actually replaced the boiler as we didn't have hot water for more than a couple of minutes, but unfortunately it only extended our showers to 7-8 minutes maximum. Like others have mentioned, the photos could be more accurate (i.e. there are no wooden beams on the ceiling). Communication with Evelien was excellent throughout our stay. She gave us great tips about where to go, addressed all of our needs, and really saved the day!"
53325,144503750,2017-04-16,106179275,Yong,Good location. Nice and friendly host. But small room and odors coming out from the toilet which makes you close the toilet sliding door all the time. 
53325,154378923,2017-05-24,27347493,StÃ©phanie,"Logement trÃ¨s bien situÃ©, on peut tout faire Ã  pied (tous les principaux sites Ã  visiter sont Ã  20-30 minutes Ã  pieds).
Endroit trÃ¨s calme, aucun bruit la nuit.
Par contre, quelques petites remarques sur le logement :
- la cuisine n'est pas du tout fonctionnelle et est trÃ¨s petite par rapport aux photos.
- nous avons eu quelques problÃ¨mes de mauvaises odeurs qui provenaient de la salle de bain.
MalgrÃ© ces 2 petites remarques, je recommande vivement ce logement. Sa localisation est vraiment un plus, et le calme la nuit en plein centre de Rome Ã©tait vraiment apprÃ©ciable."
53325,155355874,2017-05-28,115346034,Stephanie,"This place is great. Evelien checked us in and was really helpful.  The studio is centrally located, and it's easy to walk all over Rome. "
53325,157001364,2017-06-02,6463649,Samantha,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed staying at Tom's place. It's a small studio apartment but it was perfect for what we needed. The location was great- walking distance to everything we did and was easy to get to. There's a lot of restaurants on the surrounding streets so it's easy to get food close by. Evelien met up with us to give us the keys, thoroughly went over everything with us and pointed out some stuff on a map for us as well. Good communication and very easy to work with. Thanks so much!   "
53325,159197775,2017-06-10,125897936,Adam And Kristen,"We enjoyed out stay in Tom's apartment. Just enough space for us, comfortable bed, wifi, and a well stocked kitchen. The location is great - walking distance to almost everything we wanted to see in Rome. Evelien was great; she gave lots of helpful information and helped us get settled. Also, we highly recommend arranging a driver to and from the airport. It was well worth the money for the convenience and headache saved.

There were two things that were minor inconveniences. We knew about both beforehand thanks to the reviews we read. First, there are several steps to walk up to get to the apartment. It was tiresome to do so with our luggage or after a long day of walking around the city. Next, the hot water in the shower only seems to last for about 5-7 minutes. Again, this wasn't a major inconvenience, but it would have been nice to take longer showers.

Overall, a great stay and a great value!"
53325,161200434,2017-06-17,19053242,Samuel,"Tom's building is nicely tucked away on a side street near some great spots in Rome, and is an easy place to adventure outward from in any direction."
53325,164994311,2017-06-30,74796675,Olivier,"Le logement est hyper bien situÃ© et l'accueil super sympa. Mais voilÃ , la photo ne correspond pas au logement que nous avons eu..mÃªme si celui-ci est tout Ã  fait correct. La salle de bain est neuve et belle. CÃ´tÃ© cuisine c est un peu dÃ©cevant. 2 fourchettes... faudrait pas moins. Une casserole et une poÃªle de plus ce serai aussi sympa ! Frigo tellement givrÃ©, qu'il est impossible de fermer la porte du congÃ©lateur. La clim ne suffit pas pour le logement, nous avons eu extrÃªmement chaud. Enfin, il faut indiquer que le logement est au 5eme Ã©tage sans ascenseur. NÃ©anmoins, nous conservons un agrÃ©able souvenir de notre passage et remercions encore notre hÃ´te pour sa gentillesse."
53325,168365103,2017-07-09,89008197,Jonathan,"Very tidy and cosy little appartement in the center of Rome. Walking distance to all the major landmarks or a very short bus trip. Very close to bakeries, restaurants and retail shops! Great to have air conditioning in the middle of summer! Also handy to have a washing machine for laundry. Evelien welcomed us and was very helpful with showing us the area and answering any of our questions. Very efficient and quick communication. We were even able to check out late as we had an evening flight. Highly recommend this little gem in the heart of Rome! Host and service is excellent! Thank you!"
53325,191708014,2017-09-08,38735180,Benjamin,"Great location, everything you need to see is easily within walking distance. 
Evelien is a pleasure to deal with and her local knowledge really made us feel at ease."
53325,194258106,2017-09-16,40979684,An,"My husband and I had a great stay at Tomâs in Sept 2017. We didnât meet Tom, but his helper Evelien greeted us and she even helped carry my luggage up 4 flights of stairs! Evelien also gave us a wonderful introduction of Rome by providing us with a map and pointing out all the popular sites. Having an AC unit in the apartment is a huge plus. This place is so convenient, accessible to many different bus stops. You may have to get your own essentials (e.g. hand soap) from a store (there is coop close by) unless there is a leftover from previous guests. Evelien helped us arrange a transportation to the airport as we had an early flight and our driver Valentino was on time. We would stay there again."
53325,195718215,2017-09-20,134186540,Charles,"Awesome little place, close walking distance to all the sites in Rome. Host took the time to give us some great info on different areas of town and communicated with us thoroughly throughout our stay. Would highly reccomend this place to anyone looking for great value and a solid place to stay!"
53325,198392949,2017-09-29,125071037,Jaylene,"Tom's place was fantastic!  It was clean and located centrally in the city.  Tom met us himself to check us in and was extremely helpful through our entire stay!  He gave us great information about the specific area we were in as well as Rome itself.  He even offered us advice about the next city we were traveling in.  The only warning I do have for others is the stairs to get up to the apartments are steep, so it is a bit of a climb, but the location and having a very accessible and nice host was well worth it!"
53325,211514204,2017-11-13,45065455,Sam,Nice flat in a great location for visiting Rome. Went with my girlfriend and we had a brilliant time. We were met by Evelyn who told us the best places to visit - she was very knowledgeable and helped us plan a great holiday!
53325,214674568,2017-11-26,91150329,Patrick,"Brilliant location!  Tom is a great host.   

Lots of stairs on the 4th floor walk up.  If you're ok with stairs I'd recommend this place.   Kitchen isn't set up for cooking but who cares as you'll enjoy all the lovely restaurants in Rome.  Campo de' Fiori is a fun area and this apartment is in an ideal location!  Tom is very knowledgeable about the local area and very helpful."
53325,223969408,2018-01-02,14528898,Katy,"This is a lovely studio in the most perfect location - every major tourist spot (Trevi fountain, Colosseum, Pantheon etc) is no more than a ten minute walk, and there are lots of lovely restaurants and shops right next to the apartment. Tom's co-host Patrizio checked us in, and was very kind and helpful, and gave us great suggestions for where to go on New Year's Eve. The flat itself was very clean and comfortable, and not noisy despite being so central. The kitchen area is small, but very well-equipped with everything you would need to make a meal. Thank you!"
53325,232576457,2018-02-05,34282763,Sofia,"Tom es un anfitriÃ³n estupendo! Nos ofreciÃ³ otra alternativa incluso mejor al apartamento que habÃ­amos reservado previamente, sÃºper servicial y comunicativo. Super recomendable, muy buena ubicaciÃ³n."
53325,234317433,2018-02-12,129703407,Jessica,Extremely cute studio in an amazing central location that allows you to be within walking distance to the main monuments in Rome!
53325,235602697,2018-02-17,171816565,×¢×××,Great!
53325,236808359,2018-02-20,47844701,Bryan,Perfect accommodation. Tom was very responsive and the location just canât be beat.
53325,240573885,2018-03-05,9949869,Jan,"Tom was a great host! He made our stay in Rome even better by giving us great tipps for Restaurant and places to go. The location is also fantastic, you are close to everything. We would definitely stay again at Tomâs"
53325,246393052,2018-03-25,63891258,Aviv,"Fantastic, stylish, little studio in a super central yet still quiet street right near Campo De Fiori. The studio is small but well layed out and has all the amenities you need. Tom and Giovanni were both friendly and responsive and gave us great tips on resteraunts. We would absolutely stay here again and strongly reccomend!"
53325,249955716,2018-04-03,93579894,Joseph,"Location, location, location! Tom's place is a cozy studio in the Centro storico/Campo di Fiori area which is central to all the popular/main attractions in Rome. Walking distance 15 mins to most of them or a  single bus to termini. Even though it's in the city, the place is in a quiet street so that is a plus. Not to mention its nearly on top of one of the best bakeries in town, Forno Roscioli, which is frequented by locals and tourists. Tom has provided all the amenities despite the small space and has some recent-ish guidebooks decorating the apartment. Some of the drawbacks: there is no elevator and the apartment is quite small so be warned if you are a suitcase traveler. Giovanni helped us up but you may find it hard to open all the suitcases in the apartment. We had backpacks so it was fine. If you rely heavily on wifi, when it rained the connection was choppy but otherwise it was fine. Overall, Tom and Giovanni were gracious hosts and even helped us hold our bags after check out. Would stay again for the prime location!"
53325,254558383,2018-04-17,62842247,Horacio Raul,"Alojamiento muy bien ubicado, cerca de todo. Bares, restaurantes, supermercados, atracciones. 
Nos esperÃ³ y recibiÃ³ Giovanni.
EXCELENTE. Muy bien predispuesto y atento a nuestras necesidades. Nos informÃ³ todo lo necesario y tuvimos hasta el Ãºltimo minuto, que nos consiguiÃ³ el traslado al aeropuerto, comunicaciÃ³n fluida y al instante.
La Ãºnica crÃ­tica importante es la falta de microondas. La verdad fue una sorpresa no encontrarlo.
Y un poco menos, pero no vendrÃ­a mal, un placard al menos.
El resto, 10 puntos"
53325,261299384,2018-05-06,22306271,David,Good location.
53325,262791334,2018-05-10,43500129,Khai Ling,Place was pretty clean and looks like the photos. The area was walkable to all the main areas. Highly recommend :) Giovanni helped check us in and recommended a lot of nice places for us to eat!
53325,264074360,2018-05-13,1329230,Nathan,The location in Campo De Fiore was awesome.  Giovanni met us at check in.  He provided an email detailing best places for food and gelato to avoid getting ripped off in the numerous Rome tourist traps.  He also set up our ride to the airport that was so early in the morning.
53325,265508661,2018-05-17,183443088,Sam,"My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights and were so impressed with our entire experience.  The studio was in the heart of everything and situated on beautiful cobble stone walking streets.

Within 100ft was one of the best bakeries in town and dozens of incredible eats.  Tomâs welcome and attention to detail were incredible.  He was responding to our inquiries leading up to the trip and even organized a private pickup from the airport.  He then spent a full half hour with us going over maps, recommendations on things to see, and helping to make sure we had the best time.

Weâd HIGHLY recommend you choose this spot for your next trip to Rome."
53325,270414310,2018-05-29,429226,John,Awesome spot! Highly recommended!

53325,277348853,2018-06-16,40983766,Justin,"Our stay was fantastic!  Giovanni checked us in and he was great. He shared some great restaurant recommendations with us and carried our suitcases up the stairs.

If you want to see the main Rome attractions, the location of this apartment is  perfect. So much is walkable from this place and quiet enough for you to get some rest after a full day exploring. Yes, this apartment is a 4th floor walk up so if you canât do stairs this may not be the place for you. Itâs a small studio but great for 1 or 2 people who plan on spending most of their time out in the streets of Rome. Great WiFi for researching your next adventure. Kitchen is small and would likely be tough to cook in, but the refrigerator is great if you pick up snacks, water, or have leftovers.

Just a heads up for anyone wanting to do laundry, bring your own soap and some creativity as the machine only has images (not even Italian words that can be translated into your native language) and we couldnât find a manual. We managed to figure it out by tracking down a manual online for a similar (same brand) machine."
53325,295206203,2018-07-23,7647060,Jessica,"Amazing location! We were able to walk to all the major points of interest (including Colloseum and Vatican) in less than 25 minutes. There is a luggage drop and bike rental place right across from the apartment, which ended up being very convenient for us. Giovanni checked us in and was so friendly. We also met the host, Tom, and he gave us great advice and good ideas for non-touristy experiences around the city. The apartment is very basic in style and amenities, but had everything we needed for our 4 night stay. Check-in was smooth and easy and both hosts spoke English well. A great place to stay in the heart of Rome!"
53325,316471758,2018-08-31,46046690,Alex,"Our stay at Tom's apartment was disappointing. The photos made it seem like the room was going to be very nice, but they were deceptive - we were staying in a room that was a similar but noticeably different to the one the photos were taken of, so I guess there are two rooms to rent in the building. I suspect both rooms are similar and the photos were taken to make it look better and more spacious than this room was. There was a bad smell in the room we couldn't get rid of by opening the windows, it was quite unpleasant. The shower fixture was broken so the water flowed towards the wall and not down/out - had to take it off the wall to wash self (though the water pressure was good). I was glad to have a washing machine but there is only a very tiny space to hang up clothes to dry after washing. There is a tiny kitchen which we only used for breakfast cereal but there was no wash cloth, tea towel or even dishwashing detergent (we purchased some and left it in the room). The mattress and pillows were Ikea cheap stuff and were not comfortable. Had to email the host to get the Wifi password as it has rubbed off the Wifi router, luckily we had some data available as otherwise we wouldn't have had internet. 

Check in process was not smooth or comfortable - we had one person emailing us on behalf of the owner and another who actually let us in the building helped us with a suitcase up the stairs very kindly (steep 3 storey set of stairs). We had to send a photo of our passports and leave the city tax on the table when we left. No recommendations or local tips. 

The air con worked perfectly and the location was great, so if you are looking for very basic accommodation and don't mind a 'no frills' experience, this may still be suitable for you - just keep your expectations in check so it doesn't disappoint. "
53325,322208240,2018-09-12,70785102,Hila,"Nice apartment, a little smaller than we expected but it was good enough for us. Itâs a 3 floor walk up(no elevator) so be prepared. Great location, just a few steps from Campo Deâ Fiori."
53325,334554403,2018-10-09,92229324,Trevor,"Small apartment at the top of many stairs, but in the best location in Rome. Felt very safe in the area and walked to all attractions. Good communication with the host. Would highly recommend for a stay in Rome."
53325,336445441,2018-10-14,73398323,Peter,"A really nice apartment in the perfect location for exploring the city. All of our contact was with Giovani who was friendly, quick to respond and was very helpful with setting up airport transfer and giving food recommendations."
53325,349355951,2018-11-17,2210030,Kiran,"Amazing location, only 5mins from Campo dâFiori! Lovely apartment. Nice and clean with fast internet. 

Tom and Hansel gave us lots of recommendations and really helped us settle in. I wouldnât hesitate to recommend their flat and will definitely stay in the flat if I ever visit Rome again!"

53325,351841521,2018-11-24,110884894,Zack,"Terrific location!!  We could walk to all the attractions we wanted to see!  You can also take a short cab ride to some of the further sites (the Vatican and Colosseum/Roman Forum are each about a 20-30min walk), but we found that you can discover some hidden gems if you walk there instead.  Just outside the building there are many shops and restaurants.  The Campo de Fiori market is right around the corner as well for fresh fruit/veggies, cheeses & meats, gifts/souvenirs, and more dining options.  Tom and Giovanni were very hospitable hosts and quick to respond to our inquiries during our stay.  I recommend the private transportation they can arrange for you from the airport - it was cheaper than a taxi and very convenient.  When we arrived at the building Giovanni was waiting there for us and carried our bags up to the apartment.  He provided us with a bunch of great recommendations for food, drinks and attractions nearby, and showed us all we needed to know about the apartment.  The space was a little smaller than we anticipated, but was still plenty big enough for my wife and I to be comfortable for our 4 night stay.  Overall, I thought it was a great value for the location."
53325,353299027,2018-11-27,70280876,Adam,A great apartment in a great location in Rome!

53325,355169319,2018-12-03,19810612,Laura,"The location of this apartment is amazing. We have a few friends from Roma and they suggested this area and it was perfect. The apartment is on a quiet street but close to everything. Just note that you have to climb up a few flights of stairs, but this is normal in Italy. The studio apartment was pretty small but perfect for my husband and I. The bed was comfortable and apartment was cozy. We didn't use the kitchen so I cannot comment on that. The shower just needs a few minutes to warm up again for the second guest. Our host met us at check in and was very thorough. He also sent us some great, non touristy places to visit for beer, dinners and lunches. We had such a great trip in Roma and can't wait to come back soon!"
53325,355890740,2018-12-06,2934947,Brigitte,Perfect location in the center of the city!
53325,357400210,2018-12-10,5194005,Alisa,"Tomâs apartment is located in Campo diâ fiori. Everything is in a good walking distance. We couldnât have chosen a better neighborhood. We used the transfer - although itâs the same price as a taxi. But it was comfortable and easy because the driver knew where to go. Giovanni, who let us in, was really nice and gave us a map and lots of tips. 

The apartment appears bigger in the photos but we didnât care a lot as we only stayed there to sleep. As long as we could, because the walls are thin, the windows gazed with only one panes of glass and the building is absolutely not soundproof. And one of the neighbours is insane. He came home during the night (2:30 am - every night), walked up the stairs (it seemed) as loud as he could and slammed the doors. Then he stayed like 10 minutes and went out again as he came. 

The mattress should be changed some day in the near future. We both woke up with a back pain."
53325,359867915,2018-12-18,212302056,Eleanor,"We had an amazing time and it was a great base. The location made visiting all the sights so easy. We were welcomed by Giovanni, who was lovely and given some local suggestions."

The apartment is in the third floor, and nice and light with two windows. Communication with Giovanni was very friendly and helpful! We used the airport transfer, which worked out very well too."

53325,437805024,2019-04-15,81730755,Eddie,"Tom is an outstanding host.  The location is great.  The pictures in the showing are fantastic; but very misleading.  The pictures present this place as more elegant and larger.  That said, he did not lie and everything in the picture is as it is in real life.  We enjoyed our stay.  You'll notice he still receives high ratings.  If location is your priority and walking 15-30 is within your wheel well; this is the place to be.  I mean everything is within a 15-30 minute walk."

53325,445962929,2019-04-30,252869518,Carolyn,"This place is right in center of the action, yet in a very quiet location on the street. Bed was comfortable, place was clean. Tom responded immediately and went out of his way to help with washer instructions! Be sure to ask about the pass through tunnel to the market. Itâs much shorter. Would definitely stay here again in Rome."
53325,450428087,2019-05-09,5349418,Brian,"The location for this place is great.  It is walking distance to all the main tourist attractions and the neighborhood felt safe.  It was very easy to arrange a pick up from the airport to the apartment.  Some of the pictures in the listing do not match the apartment that we stayed in.  The kitchen looked a bit dirtier and a little bit different and the bathroom was completely different.  The toilet took a long time to fill up between flushes, the shower did not have enough hot water (it was just my girlfriend and I and the hot water did not make it through both showers), there was a good amount of mold/mildew in the bathroom, and there was a sulfur/musty smell in the apartment.  The apartment is also located on the 4th floor with no elevator."

Rome a memorable one. The location is fabulous as you can walk to just about anything (vatican city, compo di fiori, and most  all other sights.  He provides excellent restaurant and gellato  recommendations.  If you are looking for a place to experience the local flavors of Rome you could not do better. 
The place is clean, immaculate and just as described"

Para 2 personas esta perfecto, lo Ãºnico malo es que no tenÃ­amos equipamiento bÃ¡sico en la cocina (no habÃ­a ningÃºn tenedor y tenÃ­amos sÃ³lo 1 cuchillo, 1 cuchara, 1 taza y 1 vaso).

53325,477901962,2019-06-29,16357148,Matthew,Perfectly tiny flat in the heart of Rome. Laundry available for longer stays. Walk anywhere and everywhere. 4 flights of narrow marble steps add to the charm.

53325,485122027,2019-07-10,111647944,Sandra,"My friend and I stayed at this apartment for 4 nights. Tom suggests using a hired car service - do it! Itâs the same price as a taxi, there is a driver waiting for you at the airport, and your driver will communicate with the person checking you into the room - made it so easy to arrive after a long flight. The apartment is on the 4th floor, which can be hard to walk up after spending all day walking around Rome though. The location is amazing, within walking distance of all attractions if youâre generally âfitâ - we didnât take a taxi the entire time! There is a taxi stand on the main road nearby, we used that to get back to the airport. If I go back to Rome, I would use one of Tomâs apartments again after staying there this trip."

Tom helped set up our taxi to and from the airport with ease.  This isn't a negative thing, but there are lots of steps to get to the room. if walking up narrow steps or if you have a lot of luggage it would be hard to maneuver them.  We had a blast and will book with Tom the next time we are in Rome."

It is on 3rd floor and the staircase is narrow as it is in a historical building, but that was no problem, especially because Giovanni who checked us in, carried our luggage upstairs. Location is fantastic in the middle of Rome, we walked everywhere. Our best dinner we had at the little Pesci Fritti restaurant just across the road, a real treat!"

On recommande Pane et Salame prÃ¨s de La fontaine de Trevi, le El Duca, Lâ Otello et le Mimi et Coco dans le Trastevere! Et surtout profitez du marchÃ© quotidien au Campo sel Fiori!"

Service de transfert entre Fiumicino et le studio trÃ¨s apprÃ©ciable."

53325,613896527,2020-03-03,59868124,Harry,"I highly recommend Tom's place if you're staying in Rome! He's a great host and very knowledgeable about the city and its history. He went out of his way to make me feel at home, and even took me on a tour of the Domus of Nero! 

The apartment itself is located within walking distance of all the major sites.  If you have a bucket list of things you want to see in Rome, this is the where you should stay. I really didn't know anything about Rome before I came, so picking this place was really lucky! Two thumbs up from me I had a great time!"

Llegamos un poco tarde y nos espero sin problema, con el apartamento preparado y calentito. Nos enseÃ±Ã³ todo su funcionamiento para que no tuviÃ©semos ninguna pega en nuestra estancia. Y luego se quedÃ³ un rato hablando con nosotros y sugiriÃ©ndonos sitios para comer, desayunar, donde ir y donde no ir. Le llamamos un par de veces para que nos asesorase y respondiÃ³ rÃ¡pido y siempre con simpatÃ­a y una sonrisa. En resumen, encantador.
El apartamento es un estudio pequeÃ±o, bonito, bien equipado y cÃ³modo. Pero lo mÃ¡s importante, su ubicaciÃ³n, no hemos cogido ni un bus en seis dÃ­as. Tardas lo mismo en salir a comer que en llegar a cualquier atracciÃ³n de Roma. Todo a veinte minutos como mucho, no andando,  paseando. La Fontana de Trevi (15 min.), Plaza Navona (5 min.), Vaticano (20 min.), Coliseo, Foro,etc. (25 min.).
Nuestra hija viaja pronto a Roma y repetirÃ¡ nuestra experiencia con Ã©l. Tom, muchas gracias y encantado de conocerte."

Paola was an AWESOME host and made sure we were very comfortable while there. At the end of our stay she even provided a reasonable taxi ride to the airport and even scheduled our pick up. Will recommend this place to anyone and definitely the best stay over any hotel in ROMA."
53670,205046,2011-03-21,410749,Jon,"We stayed in the Green Tea apartment for a week, it was great!  Nice and clean, just like in the photos.  The kitchen is well-equipped if you want to do your own cooking, but this is Rome, why would you?  Try the pizza place downstairs, and the bakery just up the street.  Nom nom nom...

The best part was the location - only a few hundred meters from the Colosseum, close to the Cavour metro station, and on the bus-line which runs right up Via del Corso.

The apartment has internet access too - we couldn't get the wifi to work but the ethernet cable worked just fine.

And now I'm back at work, wishing I was still there..."

53670,253269,2011-05-06,490202,Heather,"The location is great - a 5 minute walk from the Coliseum and close to many of the other key sights. The Cavour Metro stop is just around the corner. Everything you need is on the street (internet, bank machine, small grocery store, gelato, etc.). The apartment is comfortable, the rooftop terrace has a great view, and Paola is wonderful. Bring earplugs though, since the street is noisy at night. This is a great home base for a Rome visit."
53670,489759,2011-08-31,666234,Natalie,"This is a great little flat in a fabulous location. The flat was clean and we loved the roof top terrace with the view of the colosseum. There were two small grocery stores (one a few shops down from the flat and another in the small square by the fountain) which was great for picking up supplies. 

The flat had air conditioning (essential in the summer) and neither my partner or I found it to be noisy."
53670,734754,2011-11-21,768325,David,"Matilde es encantadora y nos dio muy buenos consejos para visitar la ciudad. La ubicaciÃ³n del apartamento es perfecto, a unas manzanas del Coliseo, unos 100m del metro, con restaurantes, bares, pubs y supermercados cerca. El piso estÃ¡ perfecto, limpio, reciÃ©n renovado y muy cÃ³modo. Nos encantÃ³ y volveremos!"
